0,"[Claim]:""Oregon is the only state out of the 50 states in the USA that continues to pay 100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families.""[Evidences]:The issue of public workers and their pay and benefits is en vogue in capitols across the U.S.Oregon, it would appear, is no exception.In a recent newsletter to his constituents, Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, argues that state employees need to help pay some of the cost of their benefits packages. Right now, he notes, they’re not responsible for any of it.That, he says, makes Oregon unique: ""Oregon is the only state out of the 50 states in the USA that continues to pay 100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families.""We were of the impression, that yes, Oregon is among a shrinking number of states that pay the whole tab for public worker benefits. But the idea that Oregon would be the only state caught us off guard. So, we looked into it.First off, we confirmed with Ingrid Norberg, the spokeswoman for the Public Employees’ Benefit Board, that Oregon does, in fact, cover the full cost of certain medical benefit packages for certain employees. That said, employees are still responsible for co-payments in certain cases, she said.Once we had that confirmed, we stopped by the National Conference of State Legislatures website. The group keeps an eye on state-related issues and trends, and public employee health care plans are among them. According to a report on their site, as of 2009, ""(s)even states paid for 100 percent of the ""defined standard"" monthly premium costs for at least some familiesof state employees."" They listed those states as Alaska, Delaware, Iowa, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma and Oregon.So, we placed a call to both Rep. Richardson and the Conference to sort out the discrepancy. Richardson explained, in a voice mail, that he had taken the information from a December 2010 report by then-Gov. Ted Kulongoski’s Reset Cabinet. He cited, as his proof, one sentence in the report: ""Oregon is one of two states that pay the full cost of health benefits for employees and their dependents (the other is Alaska) and is the only state to do so in plans with no deductibles.""That’s not quite what the representative said in his newsletter, but we noted the claim and asked Richard Cauchi, the NCSL’s Health Program director, about it.As far as Cauchi knew, there were more than two states covering 100 percent of the monthly premium cost. Of the seven cited online, he believed a few had since stopped covering the full cost, but that four or five continued to do so.As for the part about deductibles, he said the group did not track plans in that detail.Before he ended the call, however, he did add some perspective on the issue: ""The one thing there is in this is a gradual, but real, trend toward employee contribution. Ten years ago there were certainly more states that paid 100 percent of the costs. That's been going down year by year. It’s been a dwindling list, if you will."" We decided to go back to one of the sources of the report: Tim Nesbitt, a former chief of staff to Kulongoski. He said the line that Oregon was one of two states to cover the full cost came from the Public Employees’ Benefit Board. We doubled back to spokeswoman Ingrid Norberg.Norberg did some checking for us and found a set of slides used in a presentation to the governor’s Reset Cabinet. Using a different set of information from the National Conference of State Legislatures, PEBB had reported that Oregon was one of six states that covered the premiums for the lowest-cost medical plan. So why did it make it into the report that Oregon was one of two?Well, according to the NCSL information, only Oregon and Alaska also cover dental and vision costs.The comparison, Norberg noted, is still difficult to make -- a ""contribution from the employer may be for a range of benefits and a range of benefit designs. So, comparing one with another is like comparing apples and bananas.""The bottom line, however, seems to be that Oregon isn’t alone here.In his newsletter, Rep. Richardson says Oregon is the only state the nation that pays ""100% of the medical benefits for its employees and their families.""That’s just not true. Even the source he cites contradicts what he wrote. And even that source was a bit misguided in its assertion about Oregon being one of two to cover medical benefits completely. Oregon is one of two states that covers a full range of benefits -- health, dental and vision -- but it’s one of at least four that covers the premiums for its lowest-cost health plan.Richardson’s larger point, that Oregon is in a shrinking group of states that do so is certainly a strong and valid one. However, he undercuts his argument by resorting to hyperbole. We find his claim False. Comment on this item.",False,False
1,"[Claim]:Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was made to disappear so one party could gain control of a multiply-owned patent.[Evidences]:Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared over the South China Sea on 8 March 2014 with 239 persons (227 passengers and 12 crew members) aboard. Several days later, a conspiracy theory was floated on the Internet that four of the passengers on that flight were all co-holders of a recently issued, highly valuable patent and the disappearance of Flight 370 was engineered to eliminate them so that remaining co-holder of the patent could reap all the royalties from it for himself: Example: [Collected via e-mail, March 2014] This was posted on facebook in a discussion of the missing Malaysia Airlines Flight:————————————————- Here’s what you all need to know. Spread this information everywhere: Four days after the missing flight MH370 a patent is approved by the Patent Office 4 of the 5 Patent holders are Chinese employees of Freescale Semiconductor of Austin TX. Patent is divided up on 20% increments to 5 holders: Peidong Wang, Suzhou, China, (20%)Zhijun Chen, Suzhou, China, (20%)Zhihong Cheng, Suzhou, China, (20%)Li Ying, Suzhou, China, (20%)Freescale Semiconductor (20%) If a patent holder dies, then the remaining holders equally share the dividends of the deceased if not disputed in a will. If 4 of the 5 dies, then the remaining 1 Patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent. That remaining live Patent holder is Freescale Semiconductor. Who owns Freescale Semiconductor? Jacob Rothschild through Blackstone (what an interesting name for a company) who owns Freescale. Here is your motive for the missing plane. As all 4 Chinese members of the Patent were passengers on the missing plane, and that patent was the breakthrough. We have entered the future proper, and four men was just murdered so that the last, still living member can keep this for himself to either hide or profit from. The improbabilities of such a theory are numerous. For starters, it’s not clear the four men referenced as patent co-holders actually were on Flight 370, as their names (as rendered above) don’t appear on the flight manifest. (It’s possible that the seeming absence of some matching names from the manifest could be due to slight differences in the transliterations of those persons’ names from Chinese to English, however.) Moreover, the patent in question is dated 11 March 2014 and involves a “system for optimizing number of dies produced on a wafer.” That doesn’t sound like a highly valuable, “breakthrough” type of patent that would prompt the murder of four people (much less the death of 235 other innocent parties) in order to gain exclusive control of it. It looks to be a patent for a procedure that moderately improves the efficiency of a particular manufacturing process, not something with a huge market base and a vast potential for profit. Additionally, the men listed are not actually the patent holders: they’re the inventors/applicants, with the patent itself having been assigned to Freescale Semiconductor, Inc., of Austin, Texas. Presumably Freescale Semiconductor is their employer, and it’s typical that engineers working in the employ of companies are required by the terms of their employment to assign ownership of their discoveries and inventions to their employers (and thus usually do not receive royalties from any resulting patents). It’s also not a given that if all but one of the co-holders of a patent dies, “then the remaining one patent holder gets 100% of the wealth of the patent” as if a patent were some form of tontine to be awarded to the last man standing. Unless prior arrangements had been made in that regard, the share of the patent held by the deceased may pass to his heirs or estate through the usual inheritance process. Finally, although the Rothschild name may be a talisman for many conspiracy theorists, it isn’t true that Jacob Rothschild “owns” Freescale Semiconductor. Freescale is a public company whose stock is held, in part, by 152 different institutional shareholders. The Blackstone Group, at which Jacob Rothschild serves as a member of the company’s International Advisory Board, is one of the largest of those institutional holders (with over 196 million shares), but the Carlyle Group and TPG Group Holdings both own a number of Freescale shares equal to that held by Blackstone.",False,Conflicting
2,"[Claim]:In January 2021, the San Francisco Board of Education passed a resolution aimed at removing the names of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, and other notable public figures from schools in the San Francisco Unified School District.[Evidences]:Dozens of public schools are under consideration to be renamed after the San Francisco Board of Education passed a resolution in late January 2021 affirming its commitment to rename schools at 46 campuses across the Golden Gate city that the board says were named after prominent figures who oppressed, or opposed, various minority groups. The approval of the resolution does not rename the schools but rather identifies those that are under consideration to be renamed by district leadership. It is expected that the suggested new names — which individuals can submit here — will be reviewed in the coming months with a final decision made by the board on April 19, 2021. The move comes after a “blue-ribbon panel” was formed in May 2018 to identify and provide a framework to change the names of schools named for “historical figures who engaged in the enslavement and subjugation of human beings,” as well as those associated with the oppression of women, those whose actions led to genocide, and those who otherwise “significantly diminished the opportunities” of individuals and their right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Forty-four schools across the 46 campuses are included in the panel’s list, from early education schools to high schools. Joining Abraham Lincoln and George Washington high schools are institutions named for colonial propagandist Paul Revere, naturalist and writer John Muir, American lawyer Daniel Webster, and the third U.S. President Thomas Jefferson, among others. “This is an opportunity for our students to learn about the history of our school’s names, including the potential new ones,” said Board President Gabriela López in a news release dated Jan. 27. “This resolution came to the school board in the wake of the attacks in Charlottesville, and we are working alongside the rest of the country to dismantle symbols of racism and white supremacy culture. I am excited about the ideas schools will come up with.” According to the School Names Advisory Committee, identified schools will be given the opportunity to propose alternative names, but any final decision rests with the Board of Education. Snopes contacted the school board to determine whether the decision was largely supported or opposed. We’ll update this story if we hear back.",True,True
3,"[Claim]:The Senate has passed an immediate order to remove the K to 12 education system[Evidences]:A video on YouTube is erroneously claiming that the Senate has passed an “immediate order” to remove the K to 12 education system. This has been debunked several times. On Feb. 9, a YouTube channel published a video that bore the false headline: “KAKAPASOK LANG GRABE! RAFFY TULFO NILUSOB ang DEPED, K-12 PROGRAM ni PNOY TANG-GAL AGAD (JUST IN: [Sen.] Raffy Tulfo charged into DepEd, late President Benigno Aquino III’s] K-12 program immediately removed)” Showing the faces of Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte, Tulfo and protesters against the K-12 program, the video thumbnail text read: “TANGGAL NA K-12 PROGRAM, BIGLAANG UTOS SA SENADO (K-12 program removed in an immediate order from the Senate”)” There are no resolutions passed nor filed in either the Senate or the House of Representatives to abolish the education program. Neither did Tulfo show up unannounced at the Department of Education (DepEd). There are no legitimate news reports related to this. In an attempt to prove its claim, the video played a June 2022 clip of Tulfo applauding Duterte’s decision to revise – not abolish – the K to 12 curriculum. During this year’s Basic Education Report, Duterte announced that the DepEd will revise the K to 12 program. “We will revise the K to 12 Curriculum to make them more responsive to our aspiration as a nation, to develop lifelong learners who are imbued with 21st-century skills, discipline, and patriotism,” she said. VERA Files has debunked a similar claim early this month. (Read DepEd to revise, NOT abolish K to 12) This clickbait video emerged two days after the House of Representatives passed a bill introducing a “ladderized approach” in the K-12 curriculum, to “ensure mastery of knowledge and skills” after each grade level.

4,"[Claim]:""The pharmaceutical industry has 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill right now trying to stop"" Medicare drug price negotiation.[Evidences]:Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., took a shot at lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry for blocking progress on a ""human infrastructure"" bill, particularly on a provision that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. During an Oct. 3 interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Sanders attacked drugmakers for spending lavishly to lobby Congress to fight an idea that polls have found is overwhelmingly popular. ""The time is now for us to stand up to powerful special interests who are currently spending hundreds of millions of dollars trying to prevent us from doing what the American people want,"" Sanders said. ""We want to lower, substantially, prescription drug costs in this country, so we're not paying 10 times more for certain drugs than Canada and other countries. And the pharmaceutical industry has 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill right now trying to stop us."" In the big picture, there’s little doubt that the pharmaceutical industry throws its weight around in Washington. But is Sanders correct about the number of lobbyists fighting the drug-negotiation provision? Not exactly. First, some background on the issue Sanders is referring to. Medicare, the federal program that covers health care costs for Americans over 65, is barred under current law from negotiating prices with pharmaceutical companies. To the frustration of Sanders and his allies, the pharmaceutical industry is interested in preserving the status quo, which keeps prices higher than they would otherwise be. (The industry argues that cutting prices would hamper innovation by shrinking the amount of money available for research and development.) A May 2021 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 88% of respondents favored allowing the federal government to negotiate for lower prices on medications, including 77% of Republicans. But pharmaceutical and health products companies have significant sway, spending more than $171 million on lobbying during the first half of 2021, according to OpenSecrets, a nonpartisan clearinghouse for campaign finance and lobbying data. That easily ranked No. 1 for any industry over that period; the second-place sector was electronics manufacturing and equipment, which spent $87 million. Asked about Sanders’ source for the lobbyist figure, his office pointed to a database of lobbyists maintained by OpenSecrets. The database counts 1,469 lobbyists whose subject area falls under the definition ""pharmaceuticals/health products."" This figure needs some important context. For starters, the category in the database called ""pharmaceuticals/health products"" includes lobbyists representing more than just drugmakers. It also includes medical device makers, nutritional and dietary supplement companies, pharmaceutical wholesalers, and companies that make personal healthcare products, such as toothpaste, said Dan Auble, a senior researcher with OpenSecrets. These industries don’t necessarily have a dog in the Medicare drug negotiation fight. A different category in the OpenSecrets database is more narrowly focused on the kinds of companies that manufacture the types of drugs that would be affected by a new rule on Medicare negotiations: ""pharmaceutical manufacturing."" The ""pharmaceutical manufacturing"" category includes a smaller number of lobbyists: 794. It’s not clear that all 794 of these pharmaceutical manufacturing lobbyists would be lobbying against the drug-negotiation provision. One of the biggest such lobbying groups is the Association for Accessible Medicines, a group formerly known as the Generic Pharmaceutical Association. The group represents companies that make generic drugs, which would likely benefit from a provision like the one Sanders is seeking. According to OpenSecrets data, the Association for Accessible Medicines has 50 lobbyists. This doesn’t take into account other groups that might benefit from a drug-negotiation provision, such as individual companies that manufacture generic drugs. It’s impossible to tell from the OpenSecrets database whether a lobbying group or lobbyist would support or oppose Medicare drug negotiation, so the bottom-line number of drugmaker lobbyists fighting the negotiation provision is uncertain. Still, even if you add to the core ""pharmaceutical manufacturing"" category by including the biotechnology sector, the most recent number of lobbyists would be 1,098, Auble said. Sanders said, ""The pharmaceutical industry has 1,400 lobbyists on Capitol Hill right now trying to stop"" Medicare drug price negotiation. The pharmaceutical industry has a large and well-funded lobbying operation, but Sanders’ figure for lobbyists is exaggerated. The group of 1,400 lobbyists cited in the OpenSecrets database includes more than just those representing drugmakers, and the narrower category that covers just drugmakers includes some groups and companies that want to see the Sanders-backed provision pass.

5,"[Claim]:Bill O'Reily hired ""university grad students"" to conduct a phone survey of 25,000 people about the presidential election.[Evidences]:On 11 October 2016, Fox News host Bill O’Reilly announced on his show that his website had posted a survey asking his viewers, “If the presidential election were held this week, who would win?” The poll question (which didn’t ask respondents to indicate whom they were voting for, but merely who they thought would win) was also displayed on-screen: Three days later, the survey — not surprisingly, given the nature of O’Reilly’s audience and the laxity of online surveys — ended with 84% of their 29,799 respondents predicting that Republican nominee Donald Trump would win the election: The tweet reproduced above misrepresented the nature of that survey, however, claiming that O’Reilly employed college graduate students to “call 250 people from each party’s voting rolls in all 50 states.” The image has since been cited by conservative websites as proof that Trump is “far ahead” of Clinton in the president race. Another similar version of a fake poll from a clickbait web site put the number of people surveyed at 700,000 and attributed it to different conservative source, One America News Network: However, this version was based on no actual survey at all; it was simply a digitally altered version of a graphic used during a 11 May 2016 report about “a nearly neck-and-neck race brewing” between the two candidates”: The claim regarding the O’Reilly “poll” was also similar to another post allegedly conducted by “graduate students” calling 1,000 homes in each state: Economy was the number one factor that Americans are concerned about and terrorism was number two. Presidential pick was Trump by a large percentage.

6,"[Claim]:Article 370 applicability extended to Nagaland. Modi gave a green signal to Nagaland for having separate flag and passport. Now, Indians cannot buy land in Nagaland.[Evidences]:A post is being shared on Facebook with a claim that the applicability of Article 370 has been extended to Nagaland by the Modi government. Let’s try to analyze the claims made in the post. The archived version of the post can be found here. Claim: Article 370 applicability extended to Nagaland. Modi gave a green signal to Nagaland for having separate flag and passport. Now, Indians cannot buy land in Nagaland. Fact: Article 371 A in the Indian constitution deals with Nagaland, not Article 370. Even, if the government want to extend the applicability of Article 370, it can only do that by amending the constitution. No such amendment was introduced in the Parliament. Also, there are already existing restrictions on buying the land in Nagaland by Indians from other states. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When searched for the special provisions of Nagaland and Article 370 on Google, it was found that special provisions to Nagaland are given under Article 371-A whereas Article 370 deals only with the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Both Article 370 and 371-A can be found in the Part XXI (Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions) of the Indian Constitution. Article 370 does not deal with Nagaland. Even if the government wants to extend the applicability of Article 370 to Nagaland, it can only do that by amending the constitution. But no such amendment was introduced in the Parliament. BJP in its 2019 Lok Sabha Manifesto has mentioned that it supports the abrogation of Article 370 and also, the annulment of Article 35A. So, it is very unlikely that it will extend the Article 370 to Nagaland. The post says that Indians cannot buy land in Nagaland after Modi extended Article 370 to Nagaland. But even if Article 370 is not extended to Nagaland, Indians from other states cannot buy land in Nagaland due to some special provisions provided to the state. It can be found on the internet that similar news related to Facebook post was published by an online site – ‘E-Pao’. The news on the website is titled ‘GOI approves separate passport and flag for Nagas: Reports’ but does not give any proper source for the information provided. Also, the same news was found on another website – ‘Imphal Times’ without any proper source. Both the websites write that the demands were approved under the Naga Peace Accord but nothing was reported in the mainstream media about the finalization of the accord. To sum it up, Article 370 has not been extended to Nagaland. Did you watch the first Episode of DECODE series on Parliament?",False,False
7,"[Claim]:Says Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget ""roadmap … doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and … adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt between now and then.""[Evidences]:In a Feb. 24, 2011, column in the Washington Post, Matt Miller, a senior fellow with the liberal Center for American Progress, criticized Republican plans for the federal budget. Miller specifically took aim at a ""roadmap"" put forth by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the chairman of the House Budget Committee.""We're so accustomed to political flimflam that, as (the late Democratic Sen.) Daniel Patrick Moynihan might have put it, we're defining truth-telling down,"" Miller wrote. He charged that leading Republicans have so far only offered ""half-truths"" about the long-term budget realities.""Thanks to House budget chief Paul Ryan, it's possible to measure the size of this fraud. And it's colossal,"" Miller wrote. ""As can never be said often enough, Ryan is absurdly hailed as a fiscal ‘conservative’ for a ‘roadmap’ that doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and that adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt between now and then.""Miller said that Ryan ""pretends we can keep federal taxes at their recent historic levels of 19 percent of gross domestic product as the boomers age. No can do. The math doesn't work. Ryan's endless red ink proves this.""As Congressional leaders and the White House negotiate over the next federal budget, we thought we’d check whether Miller fairly characterizes Ryan’s proposal -- specifically whether it’s true that Ryan’s roadmap ""doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s and … adds an unthinkable $62 trillion to the national debt.""First, we turned to Ryan’s roadmap itself. In a summary table, Ryan provided the amounts for outlays, revenues, deficits or surpluses, and debt for every year of the plan through 2083. (Yes, through 2083 -- more on that in a moment.) Ryan’s table offers these figures as a percentage of gross domestic product rather than as dollar amounts.For the question of when the budget reaches balance, Miller is correct. The percentage of GDP shifts from negative (representing a deficit) to positive (a surplus) in 2063. From that point on, the percentage stays in positive territory -- that is, in surplus -- through 2083.An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office -- Congress’s non-partisan arbiter of budgetary figures -- doesn’t list the exact year that surpluses first occur under Ryan’s plan, but it agrees that it will happen sometime between 2060 and 2080. So on this point Miller appears to be correct.How about Miller’s claim that Ryan would add $62 trillion to the debt?We couldn’t find a $62 trillion figure in either Ryan’s roadmap or in the CBO analysis. We looked back at a previous column and discovered that Miller had also mentioned the figure there. Here’s what he wrote:""According to the Congressional Budget Office, Ryan's plan would result in annual deficits of between 3.5 and 4.5 percent of GDP between now and somewhere after 2040, with a balanced budget coming only around 2063,"" Miller wrote. ""This would add at least $62 trillion to the national debt over the period. (My estimate is conservative mostly because the independent Tax Policy Center says Ryan's tax reforms would produce far less revenue than Ryan required the CBO to assume.)""In other words, the $62 trillion figure is an estimate that Miller -- not Ryan or CBO -- produced, and it doesn’t cover the debt added by Ryan’s plan through either 2080 (the final year of CBO’s analysis) or 2083 (the final year of Ryan’s projection).Miller told PolitiFact that his $62 trillion estimate was conservative, stopping the count at 2050 rather than the deficit/surplus tipping point of 2063, and using lower annual debt estimates than CBO did.Whether or not Miller's figure is right -- and the number is certainly in the trillions of dollars -- it's important to note that he was selective in choosing his time frame.That’s because between 2063 and 2080, the federal debt under Ryan’s plan is projected to disappear. In fact, by 2083, the debt under Ryan’s plan would actually turn into a surplus -- a surplus equal to one-sixth of the nation’s GDP.These numbers come from Ryan’s proposal, but CBO’s analysis essentially backs them up, agreeing that the national debt would fall to between negative 0.5 percent and positive 0.5 percent of GDP in 2080. In other words, CBO reckons that the debt would be either small, zero, or in a modest surplus by then.So while Miller has a point that it would take Ryan 52 years to balance the budget -- and that perhaps trillions of dollars in debt will be added between now and then -- the columnist leaves out the counterpoint that Ryan’s plan would eliminate the federal debt after an additional 17 to 20 years.There’s also another bit of missing context: Under the status quo, it would take even longer to reach a surplus, and the U.S. would acquire even more debt.There aren’t many budgetary projections that look 69 years into the future. But CBO does produce long-term budget analyses, including one under a scenario in which the current baseline budget numbers are adjusted to include changes to those policies that are widely expected to be enacted.Under this status-quo scenario, CBO sees the deficit growing consistently as a percentage of GDP, from 7.4 percent of GDP in 2020 to 17.2 percent in 2040, 28 percent in 2060 and 42.8 percent in 2080.So under this model there isn’t a surplus in sight at all, at least through 2080.As for debt, the situation is similar. According to CBO, the status-quo model produces debt levels that reach 433 percent of GDP by 2060 and 716 percent of GDP by 2080. The comparable numbers for Ryan’s plan are 77 percent of GDP by 2060 and essentially zero by 2080.By glossing over what happens to the debt under Ryan’s plan between 2063 and 2083, Miller does give a misleading impression of its projected full fiscal impact.Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, calls Miller’s debt assertion ""ridiculous. Yes, Ryan's plan may allow $62 trillion of debt, but that is far, far, far less than what would happen under current law.""But Miller makes two counter-arguments.First, Miller isn’t advocating the status-quo plan CBO used. To the contrary, his point is that while some of Ryan’s proposed policies are admirable, the lawmaker should be more aggressive about deficits and the debt by proposing tax increases. Such increases, which are anathema to most Republicans, could help reduce the deficit and the debt much more quickly than Ryan’s plan would.Second, 70-year budgetary estimates ought to be taken with a big grain of salt. On the one hand, economists use the tools they have available, and because much of the federal budget is dictated by long-term demographics -- including Social Security and Medicare -- experts in the field say that the numbers are reasonable approximations.Still, 2083 is as long in the future as 1939 is in the past. Any estimates made in 1939 about what the nation’s economy would look like in 2011 would not have accounted for factors that were unimaginable then, from the baby boom to free trade policies to computerization and the Internet.""Ryan is the one who claims his plan is ‘conservative,’"" Miller told PolitiFact. ""The idea that he runs 62 or 80 or 100 trillion in debt but then pledges to do better when all of us are long dead is silly.""So where does this leave us?On the one hand, Miller’s statement fails to mention the fact that Ryan’s plan does eventually eliminate the debt, according to CBO -- a sizable achievement when one realizes that under status quo policies, the debt would be more than seven times the size of the nation’s economy. Still, an outcome 70 years from now is subject to a lot of uncertainty, and Miller’s actual statement was phrased carefully. It’s true, as he says, that Ryan’s plan ""doesn't balance the budget until the 2060s,"" and before it gets there, it will probably add trillions of dollars in debt. It’s a close call, but we rate his statement Mostly True.",True,True
8,"[Claim]:The Daily Mail article’s headline states that “Scotland will let pupils change gender aged FOUR without their parents' consent”.[Evidences]:New guidance for teachers in supporting transgender young people has been reported in a number of news outlets. The Daily Mail, The Telegraph and GB News were among those who reported on the document. The online version of The Daily Mail’s article is headlined “Scotland will let pupils change gender aged FOUR without their parents’ consent – and tells teachers not to question a child’s request to choose a new name or use a different toilet”. In the print version of the newspaper, the headline was “Pupils, 4, will be able to swap gender in school without parents’ consent”. Pupils, 4, will be able to swap gender in school without parents’ consent. Daily Mail headline Ferret Fact Service looked at this claim and found it Mostly False. Evidence The Scottish Government released new guidance for teachers and school staff on 12 August 2021, called “Supporting Transgender Pupils In Schools: Guidance for Scottish Schools”. It is intended to advise staff who may need to help trans and gender non-conforming young people in schools. It offers advice on a number of issues including tackling transphobic bullying, helping young people who are ‘coming out’ as transgender, using the correct pronouns and use of toilets and changing rooms. The Daily Mail article’s headline states that “Scotland will let pupils change gender aged FOUR without their parents’ consent”. This is misleading. The guidance provides information for teachers to support those who are questioning their gender identity or who are coming out as transgender. In a section about changing a pupils name and recorded sex, the document states that some pupils may “choose to tell others informally that they want to use a different name”. This does not need to be changed on the school’s record but the new name can be added to the ‘known as’ section. If a young person under 16 years old wants to change their name or recorded sex formally, the guidance states they can write to the school with their parents or carers to get the record altered. The guidance states: “Recognising the rights of all parents and carers, it is recommended that consent is obtained from all of those with parental responsibilities for those young people under 16.” Someone aged under 16 in Scotland cannot legally change their name but a parent or caregiver can do so through a statutory declaration, which is an oath signed by the parent and administered by a solicitor, notary public, or other officer of a court. Any young person can informally change the name by which they are known, and the Scottish Government’s guidance suggests that teachers and school staff should respect this. The Daily Mail article refers to letting pupils “change gender aged FOUR”. The guidance states that “some young people are exploring their gender identity in primary school settings”, but urges that careful professional judgement be used to “ensure support offered is age appropriate”. Ferret Fact Service verdict: Mostly False The headline in the Daily Mail article is misleading. The guidance states that young people who change their pronouns and wish to be known by a different name should be supported and this should not be denied to them. Pupils are free to use any name or pronouns they feel comfortable with, and the guidance encourages school staff to respect a person’s chosen identity. If someone who is under 16 wants to change their sex formally, the document recommends this should be done with their parents or caregivers permission.

9,"[Claim]:"" Over the past five years..more than R1.3 trillion has been invested to build [infrastructure including] hundreds of thousands of new homes...""[Evidences]:South African President Cyril Ramaphosa delivered his second state of the nation address in parliament on 7 February. It was also the fifth - and final - Sona address of the current administration before this year's national elections in May. But did the president get his facts right as he listed the government's achievements? Africa Check partnered with 24-hour news channel eNCA to fact-check his claims on the night. The economy Claim ""In 2017, we recorded an inflow of foreign direct investment amounting to R17 billion."" Verdict correct Foreign direct investments are made by companies or individuals from one country into businesses in another country. Data from the UN Conference on Trade and Development shows that US$1.325 billion of foreign money was invested in South Africa in 2017. This is about R17.3 billion at the 30 June 2017 exchange rate. It's a however a decrease from US$2.235 billion - or R29.2 billion - in 2016. The figures sounded ""about right"", said Prof Jannie Rossouw, head of the school of economic and business sciences at Wits University . But ""it's nothing in the bigger scheme of things... it's less than a percentage [point] of our economy"". -Cayley Clifford READ: Misleading to say South Africa's GDP has grown 'three fold' since 1994 Claim ""The World Bank's annual Doing Business Report currently puts South Africa number 82 out of 190 countries that they have tracked with regard to being able to do business in an efficient way."" Verdict correct The World Bank's ""ease of doing business"" index rates countries on a scale of 0 (absolute poor ease of doing business) to 100 (absolute better ease of doing business). The score is calculated from indicators such as how long it takes to open a business or transfer a property and how easy it is to access credit. South Africa was ranked 82nd with a score of 66.03 in 2018. New Zealand was ranked first, with a score of 86.59. The report says high-ranking countries ""are those that have consistently well designed business regulation or whose regulatory environments have thrived thanks to comprehensive reform over the years"". Somalia placed last at 190th, with a score of 20.04. - Lloyd Hazvineyi Infrastructure Claim ""Over the past five years, we've made significant progress with the provision of infrastructure. More than R1.3 trillion has been invested."" Verdict mostly-correct Some R1.26 trillion was spent on infrastructure in the last five financial years, according to numbers from the national treasury.

The treasury says capital items such as equipment, machinery and vehicles are excluded. But public housing, maintenance and repairs are part of the definition of infrastructure spending applied here. - Liesl Pretorius Claim "" Over the past five years..more than R1.3 trillion has been invested to build [infrastructure including] hundreds of thousands of new homes..."" Verdict correct Public housing is included in the national treasury's definition of public-sector infrastructure spending . According to the department of human settlements, close to 500,000 homes, or ""housing units"", were delivered in the past five financial years.

Verdict correct The Youth Employment Service initiative was launched on 27 March 2018 with the aim of creating a million jobs for young people using ""innovation and technological best practice"". Only 6,939 'work experiences' committed so far The initiative is a partnership between the government, business, labour and civil society. It will provide work experience, job placements (or the option for businesses to ""sponsor"" work placements) and training for people aged 18 to 35. According to its website, 319 companies have registered for the service so far but only 6,939 ""work experiences"" have been confirmed. - Naphtali Khumalo READ: Has SA's President Ramaphosa kept his 2018 State of the Nation promises? Social grants Claim ""Every month 17.5 million social grants are provided to South Africans."" Verdict correct The South African Social Security Agency administers social grants. Its most recent data on grants is from December 2018, when 17,731,402 social grants were paid. The lowest number of grants delivered in 2018 was 17,396,831 in January. The average for the 2017/18 financial year ending in March 2018 was 17,509,555 grants. The number has however grown steadily - in 2007/08 the average was 12,423,739.

"" There is abundant evidence that grants improve nutrition – especially for children – and health, and provide dignity to otherwise marginalised social and demographic groups,"" Seekings said. - Lee Mwiti FACTSHEET: Social grants in South Africa – separating myth from reality Education Claim ""Over 700,000 children [accessed] early childhood education in the last financial year..."" Verdict downplayed This isn't the first time Ramaphosa has underestimated the number of children in early childhood development facilities in South Africa. In last year's State of the Nation address, he put the number at "" nearly one million children "". This year, his figure is ""over 700,000"". Both are way below the actual numbers. Martin Gustafsson, an economics researcher at the University of Stellenbosch , says there are "" widespread misperceptions around how many children in South Africa attend some form of ECD institution"". He has researched and written extensively on the economics of education and pre-school participation. 'How seriously South Africa takes education' Using data from Statistics South Africa, Gustafsson estimates that 2,409,953 children were in some kind of pre-school in 2016. ( Note: These were children who were younger than eight at the start of 2016. ) The 2017 general household survey reported that just over 2 million children under the age of four were attending a ""day care centre, crèche, early childhood development centre (ECD) playgroup, nursery school or preprimary school"". Knowing how many children are in these facilities is important for the government's policy planning. Gustafsson adds that the existing underestimates may send the wrong signal to international investors about ""how seriously South Africa takes the education of its citizens"". - Kate Wilkinson Claim ""Over the past five years… [we've built] two new universities."" Verdict correct In 2014, Sol Plaatje University in Kimberley, Northern Cape, and the University of Mpumalanga in Nelspruit opened their doors to students. According to the public infrastructure update in the 2018 Budget Review, construction at these institutions is ongoing . "" New facilities include lecture rooms, laboratories, sport and recreation amenities and student accommodation."" - Liesl Pretorius Claim ""We launched the Safe initiative in August last year..."" Verdict correct The Sanitation Appropriate For Education ( Safe) initiative was launched on 14 August 2018. Partners in the project include the department of basic education , National Education Collaboration Trust and Nelson Mandela Foundation . Its main objective is to replace unsafe school toilet facilities - like pit latrines - with safe ones. A national government audit of schools in May and June 2018 found that at 3,898 schools the only toilets available were pit latrines. Another 3,040 had ""proper sanitation"", but pit toilets were still on the premises. - Lloyd Hazvineyi READ: Have 'hundreds' of kids drowned in school pit latrines in South Africa? Claim ""... Since we launched the initiative, 699 schools have been provided with safe and appropriate sanitation facilities and projects and a further 1,150 schools are either in planning, design or construction stages."" Verdict unproven The president's figures were from December 2018, the department of basic education told Africa Check. Since then 88 more schools have been completed, bringing the total to 787, spokesperson Troy Martens told Africa Check. Companies that pledged to support the plan have also been meeting their obligations, Martens added. But it was difficult to independently verify the department's numbers, two education-focused civil society organisations told Africa Check. - Lloyd Hazvineyi Tourism Claim ""In the past year we had 10 million tourists who came to our country, which is a huge increase ."" Verdict unproven Statistics South Africa defines a tourist as ""an overnight visitor who stays at least one night in collective or private accommodation in the place visited"". In 2017 South Africa had 10,825,197 tourists, according to the agency. It had 10,044,163 tourists in 2016 and 8,903,773 in 2015. Full data for 2018 is not yet available but, from January to November 2018 there were 9,464,950 tourist arrivals, according to Stats SA's tourism and migration report released in January 2019. It seems likely that the figure will increase to 10 million tourists. But in the absence of data for the full year we rate the claim unproven.

12,"[Claim]:Says Jay-Z set up a $15 million trust fund for Nipsey Hussle’s children.[Evidences]:After news of rapper Nipsey Hussle’s violent death shocked the hip-hop and entertainment worlds, a report circulatedthat Jay-Z had established a hefty trust fund for the late rapper’s two children. As heartwarming as it sounded, however, the account was rapidly debunked by multiple entertainment websites and blogs. Thestory of the supposed trust fund was published on April 4 on PopularSuperStars.com, described by several entertainment websites as a ""fake"" hip-hop blog known for sharing questionable content. The article, which has been shared on Facebook more than 2,200 times, was flagged as part of the social media platform’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story does not provide any source for its claim. It simply says that Jay-Z ""quietly put together a trust fund for Nipsey’s children and you won’t guess how much it’s worth."" It then goes on to allege Jay-Z made Hussle’s partner, Lauren London, ""the executor of a trust that is worth $15 million; its beneficiaries are his daughter Emani and son (with London), Kross."" We attempted to contact the author of the article, or anyone who writes for the website, but no contact information exists on the website. Its Facebook page appears to have been taken down. Jay-Z did have a relationship with Hussle. And after Hussle’s death, Jay-Z posted a picture of Hussle on his Instagram account with the caption: ""RIP Nipsey Hussle. Another tragic loss for Hip-Hop. Condolences to his family."" In fact, according to Los Angeles Police Commissioner Steve Soboroff, Hussle and representatives of Jay-Z’s Roc Nation had scheduled a meeting with the agency to ""talk about ways (Hussle) could help stop gang violence."" It was slated to take place the day after Hussle died. We (@LAPDChiefMoore and I ) were meeting , at the request of @NipseyHussle with him and @rocnation tomorrow at 4pm to talk about ways he could help stop gang violence and help us help kids. I’m so very sad https://t.co/rcGtvw9c6L But there is no evidence to suggest that Jay-Z has arranged a trust fund for Hussle’s kids. And not a single credible media outlet or entertainment news website has reported on the alleged donation. We reached out to Jay-Z’s record label, Roc Nation, for comment on the story but did not hear back. Soon after the trust fund story was discredited, fans quickly took to social media to call it out: not ONE credible website reported jay z setting up a trust fund for nipsey hussle's kids. just one particular website known for clickbait and posting fake news. google is your friend. Jay-Z waking up this morning discovering the world was under the assumption that he set up a $15 million dollar trust fund for Nipsey's kids pic.twitter.com/ec7pjKKaGX Lol Oh yea BTW...That FAKE CLICKBAIT story about Eric Holder’s family members getting killed also came from the SAME WEBSITE that told y’all Jay-Z made a $15 mil trust fund for Nipsey’s kids, but hey what do I know , I only do my homework before posting 🤷🏾‍♂️🚨 A story posted on an entertainment blog claims that Jay-Z set up a ""$15 million trust fund"" for the late Nipsey Hussle’s children.

In Golding's caption, he wrote, ""And lefties wonder why I am against all this LGBT 'Pride' crap? I am not daft. I can see where this is leading."" And lefties wonder why I am against all this LGBT 'Pride' crap?I am not daft. I can see where this is leading. pic.twitter.com/9irxoI0rl9 — Paul Golding (@GoldingBF) June 27, 2023 We also found several other postings of the picture, also from June 2023. At least one tweet claimed that the photograph had been captured during a Seattle Pride event that reportedly included some nude men, a subject that we comprehensively reported about in a different article. From everything we could find, yes, this photograph really did show children walking past at least four naked men (their genitalia have been blurred in the tweet). In fact, there were likely many more naked men and women just outside of the frame. As for the truth about the setting of the picture, however, it was captured at the World Naked Bike Ride (WNBR) in London and not at a specific Pride event. The event occurred on June 10, 2017. A thorough search of Flickr.com led us to a helpful and uncensoredphotographthat was uploaded onJune 12, 2017. The picture appeared to show the same man who was wearing a colorful headband and leis in the photograph that Golding had tweeted. According to the WNBR London Facebook page, the event's main purpose is to ""demonstrate the vulnerability of cyclists"" as ""a protest against car culture."" A search of the WNBR London Facebook page's recent posts and photographs did not appear to show any content specifically related to Pride month. The only reference that we found on the page about LGBTQ+ issues was the fact that one of the page's managers apparently chose to like a separate page namedPride Ride London.

14,"[Claim]:Two people in Florida were arrested for selling golden tickets to heaven.[Evidences]:On 31 March 2015, the web site Stuppid published an article reporting that two people were arrested in Jacksonville, Florida, for selling golden tickets that guaranteed the holders entrance to heaven upon their demise: Tito and Amanda Watts were arrested over the weekend for selling “golden tickets to heaven” to hundreds of people. The couple, who sold the tickets on the street for $99.99 per ticket, told buyers the tickets were made from solid gold and each ticket reserved the buyer a spot in heaven — simply present the ticket at the pearly gates and you’re in. “People can sell tickets to heaven,” a Jacksonville police spokesman said. “But the Watts misrepresented their product. The tickets were just wood spray painted gold with ‘Ticket to Heaven — Admit One’ written in marker. You can’t sell something as gold when it’s not. That’s where the Watts crossed the line into doing something illegal.” Many readers shared the above-referenced story via social media, apparently believing that two people named Tito and Amanda Watts were actually arrested for perpetrating this form of scam. The report, however, was just another fabricated clickbait tale from a fake news site. Stuppid.com‘s disclaimer advises readers that the site publishes the “stupidest, craziest stuff we can find,” and the stuff they “find” is typically made up by them. Popular past hoaxes from Stuppid include reports of a Nazi couple accidentally receiving sperm from a black donor, a 14-year-old girl’s giving birth to Jesus, and a toddler’s being thrown from a roller coaster. The photograph of “Tito Watts” that accompanied the original article was an unrelated 2011 image taken from a collection of bizarre police mugshots Later versions of this hoax changed the protagonists from a Florida couple to a “Zimbabwe pastor.”",False,False
15,"[Claim]:The administration has issued rules for ""$1 abortions in ObamaCare"" and ""requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay"" an abortion premium.[Evidences]:Many readers have asked us to review a recent claim reverberating around the Internet that stems from an article posted on an anti-abortion website, lifenews.com. The March 12, 2012, article is titled, ""Obama Admin Finalizes Rules: $1 Abortions in ObamaCare."" Referring to a rule recently issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, lifenews.com published the following: ""It’s official. The concern pro-life organizations had about the ObamaCare legislation funding abortions has been confirmed, as the Obama administration has issued the final rules on abortion funding governing the controversial health care law. Nestled within the ‘individual mandate’ in the Obamacare act — that portion of the Act requiring every American to purchase government-approved insurance or pay a penalty — is an ‘abortion premium mandate.’ This mandate requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion. As a result, many pro-life Americans will have to decide between a plan that violates their consciences by funding abortion, or a plan that may not meet their health needs."" We’ll look at whether the Obama administration has issued rules for ""$1 abortions in ObamaCare"" and required ""all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion."" (We emailed lifenews.com but did not hear back.) As we’ve noted before, abortion has been a thorny issue in the process of drafting and enacting a health care law from the beginning. Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military. But the health care reform bill set up health care ""exchanges"" in which private insurance companies can compete for the business of buyers who do not get their insurance through an employer. The question became: Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do) when operating through the exchanges? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? The final rules from HHS don’t dramatically alter the approach taken by the law itself. For starters, when the exchanges begin operating in 2014, some states will ban all abortion coverage entirely for any plan selling on that state’s exchange. Doing so is allowed by a state ""opt-out"" clause that was passed as part of the health care law. According to the National Right to Life Committee, 15 states have passed such laws so far, with other legislatures considering similar measures. Beyond that, every state must offer at least one plan on its exchange that doesn’t cover abortion, and that plan will include the same minimum benefit package for non-abortion services that is required of every other plan sold on the exchanges. In addition, no private insurer will be forced to cover abortion; doing so will be their choice, at least in states that choose to allow it. However, unless and until opt-out laws are passed by the other 35 states, insurers will be allowed to sell policies on the exchanges that include abortion coverage. To allow this yet still abide by the Hyde Amendment, sponsors of the bill drafted a special procedure to differentiate between dollars spent on abortion coverage and dollars spent for everything else. (Anti-abortion advocates have consistently argued that the approach doesn’t offer strong enough protections to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion. More on that later.) Any insurer offering a plan on the exchange that includes abortion coverage must set up two separate accounts for dollars received and paid. One account would hold money that is used to pay for abortion services (except for abortions that are the result of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother, which may be paid for under the Hyde Amendment). The other account would hold money that is used to pay for everything else. All federal dollars, such as federal subsidies received by purchasers on the exchange whose incomes are low enough to qualify for them, would be deposited in the non-abortion account. Most of the premiums paid by the plan’s beneficiaries would also go into this account, but a fraction of individual premium payments would be sent to the abortion account, so that enough money is available to pay for claims submitted by beneficiaries for abortion services. The Obama administration has issued rules for ""$1 abortions in ObamaCare"" So where does that $1figure come from? HHS has determined the minimum amount that insurers offering plans that include abortion must allocate per beneficiary into this abortion account. An insurer ""may not estimate such a cost at less than $1 per enrollee, per month,"" HHS said. That’s where it comes from. But what does it mean? It means that a plan cannot contribute less than $1of premiums per month per beneficiary into the abortion fund. That’s all. It doesn’t mean that abortions will cost one dollar -- which seems an obvious interpretation of the phrase ""$1 abortions in ObamaCare."" Rather, it’s a way of filling the account so that there’s enough money to pay abortion providers for their services. The actual amount per enrollee per month may be a lot higher, depending on what the insurer’s actuaries determine. So the claim of ""$1 abortions"" is ridiculously inaccurate. What about the second claim? The law ""requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion."" This claim echoes many made by anti-abortion advocates since the law was first proposed. Critics argue that the health care law’s protections against taxpayer dollars being used to fund abortions are inadequate. ""The most objectionable aspect is that it is a smokescreen intended to conceal the new and massive federal subsidies (‘tax credits’) to health plans that cover abortion on demand -- a sharp break from decades of federal policy,"" said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. ""Under Medicaid and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, for example, federal funds do not go to plans that cover elective abortions."" But let’s parse the lifenews.com statement closely. For starters, it refers to ""all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion services"" -- but the issue at hand actually affects only persons who purchased insurance from the exchanges. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by 2018, there will be 24 million people buying insurance through the exchanges, compared to 184 million people with either employer-provided insurance or individually purchased insurance outside the exchanges. So the maximum number of people theoretically affected by this concern is 12 percent of private-insurance beneficiaries in 2018. And that number could decline substantially once you subtract residents of the 15 states (or more) that bar any abortion coverage in exchange-sold policies, and after you subtract those individuals that purchase one of the non-abortion options required to be offered by the exchanges. This group falls well short of ""all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion."" But even this is a side issue. We have ruled in the past that the health care law does not provide federal funding for abortion. Our conclusion was that even if you have the opportunity to buy abortion coverage on the exchanges -- and Americans in many states won’t have that option -- you won’t be forced to buy such coverage. Non-abortion options will always be available on the exchanges, and tax dollars sent to those plans through federal subsidies will be placed in accounts walled off from accounts used to pay for abortion services. This all means that anyone purchasing a plan with abortion coverage will be be doing so by choice and paying for it personally. On March 16, 2012, Johnson, of the National Right to Life Committee, and his colleague, senior legislative counsel Susan T. Muskett, raised an issue about the way the law is worded. They wrote that ""if a health plan covers abortion, the rule forbids the plan from calling attention to that fact in any of its advertising or explanatory materials. The disclosure of abortion coverage can be provided ‘only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment.’ This provision seems designed for no other purpose than to ensure that many people who would not deliberately sign up for abortion-covering plans will do so inadvertently."" The text of the law does include this line: ""A qualified health plan that provides for coverage of (elective abortion) shall provide a notice to enrollees, only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment, of such coverage."" This use of the word ""only"" does seem to raise the risk that a plan’s abortion provisions won’t be fully transparent to the buyer. But we think the law does ensure disclosure for any potential purchaser who is paying attention. HHS describes the disclosure summary in question as something akin to the nutritional labels on food -- a standardized form that will allow consumers to easily compare one plan’s features to another’s before they buy. ""Before choosing a health plan, consumers will know whether the plan covers these services,"" said HHS spokeswoman Erin Shields. Our ruling The claim that the Obama administration has issued rules for ""$1 abortions in ObamaCare"" is ridiculous; the administration has simply set a floor for how much money per month of the premiums paid by those who have chosen plans that include abortion must be placed in a segregated account in order to make sure that there’s enough money available to pay for abortion services incurred by people enrolled in that plan. The bigger charge -- that the Obama health care law ""requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion"" -- is also incorrect. The provision in question only affects people who purchase insurance plans that cover abortion and who do so on the exchanges -- a much narrower group than the claim suggests. And people who make such purchases will be paying their private dollars into abortion coverage accounts voluntarily. Despite some puzzling wording, ultimately the law allows for full disclosure of its abortion rules at the most obvious time, when someone is signing up for coverage. On balance, we rate this claim False.",False,True
16,"[Claim]:“In the 40, 50 years of the Endangered Species Act, we’ve recovered very few species. … The act itself hasn’t really been successful in saving very many species.”[Evidences]:Comment on this story Comment Gift Article Share “In the 40, 50 years of the Endangered Species Act, we’ve recovered very few species. … The act itself hasn’t really been successful in saving very many species.” — EPA Administrator Andrew Wheeler, in an interview on Fox Business Network, Aug. 14 Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The Trump administration has finalized new rules to weaken the Endangered Species Act of 1973, a bedrock wildlife conservation law that bars the development of lands where at-risk species live. In a Fox Business interview, Wheeler defended the regulatory changes, stating that the ESA has “recovered very few species.” Government statistics show that 47 species of plants and animals deemed at risk under the ESA have been “recovered,” out of nearly 2,000 that have appeared on the list. But Wheeler is using a very strict definition of what it means to save a species from extinction. These conservation efforts work over many years, and not all species joined the list in 1973. The ESA could be helping a “threatened” or “endangered” species regrow its population significantly before U.S. officials classify it as “recovered” and take it off the list. The Facts President Richard M. Nixon signed the bipartisan Endangered Species Act following simpler conservation statutes passed in 1966 and 1969. The Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) administers the parts of the law that pertain to land and freshwater wildlife, and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) is responsible for most marine and anadromous wildlife. Advertisement A plant or animal breed can be listed as either “endangered” or “threatened” under the ESA after an assessment of its risk of extinction. “Once a species is listed, powerful legal tools are available to aid the recovery of the species and to protect its habitat,” according to a 2016 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. “Among these legal tools are the ESA’s prohibition of unpermitted ‘take’ (e.g., killing, capturing, or harming) of endangered species and its requirement that agencies, in consultation with FWS or NMFS as applicable, ensure that their actions are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or result in destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.” The ESA routinely stirs debate, and Wheeler is not the first Republican official to question the law’s effectiveness by noting the relatively small number of delisted species. “While most demographic groups support species conservation to some degree, that support is stronger among urban and suburban populations and less so in rural areas, and is stronger among those along the coasts and less so in central and mountain states,” according to the CRS report, which adds that “some industries (e.g., logging and land development) generally see the ESA as a serious problem, while others (e.g., some commercial fishing and many recreation interests) see it as generally supporting their interests.” Advertisement As part of its deregulatory agenda to support such industries as oil and gas, the Trump administration has finalized new rules that could shrink the habitat set aside for wildlife while allowing more oil and gas drilling on those lands. The new regulations from the Commerce and Interior departments, which are not retroactive, also “remove tools that officials use to predict future harm to species as a result of climate change” and “reveal for the first time in the law’s 45-year history the financial costs of protecting” endangered or threatened species, as The Washington Post’s Darryl Fears reported Monday. Only Congress can change the wording of the law, but the executive branch has discretion to interpret what it says and how to enforce it. Therefore, regulatory changes can have big practical effects. As The Post reported, had the Trump administration’s new rules been in place in 2010, it would have been nearly impossible to designate the polar bear as a threatened species. The decision to add the polar bear to the list in 2010 was made because of melting sea ice in the Arctic. Advertisement The Trump administration’s regulatory changes are set to take effect in the coming weeks. Here’s a rundown of other key elements in the package, from The Post’s report on Monday: The new rules would also limit the area of land that can be protected to help species recover and survive. Currently, land that plants and animals occupy is set aside for their protection, in addition to areas that they once occupied or might need in the future. Now, critical habitat that is not occupied might not be protected, opening it up for oil and gas exploration or other forms of development. Another rule change stripped away language that said a secretary “shall make a [listing] determination solely on the basis of the best scientific and commercial information regarding a species’ status,” regardless of its costs. By removing that sentence, the administration allowed the interior and commerce secretaries to consider the economic impact of a listing. Potential threats to business opportunities and other costs can now be factored by the government and shared with the public. In the Fox Business interview, Wheeler defended the moves and said the ESA “hasn’t really been successful in saving very many species.” “Administrator Wheeler’s statement is accurate, 47 out of 1,900 is considered ‘very few,’ ” said EPA spokesman Michael Abboud. As noted above, government statistics show that 47 species of plants and animals deemed at risk under the ESA have been “recovered” or taken off the list, out of nearly 2,000 that have appeared. Another 18 species are being considered for delisting. The ratio of listed-to-recovered species is low, but by focusing on that ratio, Wheeler takes a straitjacketed view of what it means to be successful in wildlife conservation. Advertisement Scientists have credited the ESA with bringing back from the brink of extinction such iconic species as the bald eagle, the grizzly bear, the California condor, the American alligator, the peregrine falcon, the humpback whale, the black-footed ferret, the Florida manatee, the Tennessee purple coneflower and others. As the Congressional Research Service found: The answer to this question [whether the ESA has been effective in saving endangered species] depends very much on the choice of measurement. A major goal of the ESA is the recovery of species to the point at which the protection of the ESA is no longer necessary. If this is the standard, the ESA might be considered a failure, because only 34 species have been delisted due to recovery, as of July 25, 2016. Ten species have become extinct since their listing; eight have been delisted due to scientific reclassification of the species; and eleven have been delisted due to improved data, changes in the law, or improved scientific understanding. In the case of the species now believed extinct, some were originally listed to protect any last remaining few that might have been alive at the time of listing. It can be quite difficult to prove whether extraordinarily rare species are simply that, or in fact are already extinct. For example, two bird species, the ivory-billed woodpecker and the Eskimo curlew, are both listed as endangered, though confirmed sightings are so rare or so far in the past that these birds may actually be extinct; proving a negative (i.e., that such species do not exist any longer) is quite difficult. Rare species are, by definition, hard to find. Even so, because some scientific studies have demonstrated that most species are listed only once they are very depleted (e.g., median population of about 400 animals for vertebrates listed as endangered according to one study), another measure of effectiveness might be the number of species that have stabilized or increased their populations, even if the species is not actually delisted. If this is the standard, the ESA could be considered a success, since a relatively large number (41% of listed species according to one study) have improved or stabilized their population levels. One could also ask what species might have become extinct if there were no ESA: some species (e.g., red wolves and California condors) might not exist at all without the ESA protection, and this too might be considered a measure of success, even though the species are still rare. So, as of 2016, focusing on the number of delisted species produced a low success rate of less than 1 percent. But focusing on species that had improved or stabilized their population — short of the U.S. government’s threshold for delisting — produced a success rate of 41 percent, based on a 2015 study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. J. Michael Scott, an emeritus professor in the fish and wildlife department of the University of Idaho, previously told PolitiFact that studies suggest “more than half of the endangered and threatened populations are stable or improving, and that percentage increases with the length of time the species has been protected.” Advertisement In its fact check of former Rep. Cynthia M. Lummis (R-Wyo.), PolitiFact found that, as of 2013, “only one-half of 1 percent of species placed on the list have become extinct, which works out to a success rate of over 99 percent plus” and that “one could just as easily say that less than 1 percent of the species placed on the list have become extinct, and that many species have improved without being delisted.” Extinction, of course, is part of the circle of life. Ask the dinosaurs. But “many scientists are concerned that the current rate of extinction exceeds background extinction rates over time,” the CRS report noted. A Trump administration official said: “Delisting a species is the ultimate goal of ESA as it shows that the species is fully recovered with a strong scientific record. Settling for population improvements or some habitat recovery is not something this administration is willing to do. Recovery remains our ambitious goal.” The Pinocchio Test Wildlife conservation efforts take many years to work, and the U.S. government’s scientific threshold for a “recovered” species is set high. Advertisement Focusing on that metric, as Wheeler did, gives an incomplete view of how the Endangered Species Act works. Studies show that 40 percent to nearly half of at-risk species have improved or stabilized their populations under ESA protection. Many of these plants and animals may be delisted one day; some species may never be delisted and still be considered saved. Wheeler described the 47 delisted species out of nearly 2,000 as a low batting average. He said the law “hasn’t really been successful in saving very many species” and also said “we’ve recovered very few species.” Although his comments are technically accurate (especially when he uses the term “recovered,” which is the government’s term for delisted species), the EPA chief leaves out the population gains before species are delisted, which in many cases are substantial.

Ditto for ad copy such as “My friends tell me the graphics are the best. I don’t know what that means, but …” and “Stevie likes to play alone, even if he has no idea what’s happening.” Indeed, the Atari ad was merely a spoof using an altered version of a real print advertisement featuring Wonder endorsing the Mu-Tron III envelope filter made by Musitronics Corporation: ",False,Conflicting

The social media posts on the project estimates are fake. A social media post has become viral, claiming that in 2012 the UPA government initiated the new Parliament building project with an estimated cost of ₹3000 crores, but the BJP government under Modi has planned to complete the project in just ₹970 crores. In 2012, the Speaker of the House, Meira Kumar, accorded approval to the proposal for construction of a new Parliament building as the structure showed signs of distress and overused. However, the project did not kick-off, and only deliberations took place on the topic. We did not find any media report or documents relating to the cost estimate or fund allocation to complete the project. The ₹3000 crores estimated figure merely seems to be fictitious. Whereas the current Central Vista project, which involves constructing a new triangular Parliament building, a common central secretariat, new buildings for the Prime Minister and Vice-President, is a ₹20,000 crore project. In that, the new Parliament building is expected to cost ₹971 crores. We mark the claim as False as the UPA government did not initiate the project but merely consulted on its construction. Furthermore, no cost estimates were publicized during the project consultation in 2012.",False,False

The Daily Mail report reads in part: “Mission IMPOSSIBLE: NASA warns even a nuclear bomb wouldn't stop a giant asteroid heading for Earth after massive six month simulation exercise ends in devastating impact. “In a simulated exercise, US and European scientists were told they had six months to come up with a lifesaving plan to stop a massive rock smashing into Earth that had been spotted 35 million miles away.” Fictitious asteroid A NASA spokeswoman confirmed the purported asteroid is not real. “The social media post appears to misinterpret the hypothetical asteroid impact simulation, which occurred during the 7th International Academy of Aeronautics Planetary Defense Conference,” NASA spokeswoman Karen Fox told AFP. “This exercise was purely a simulation and involved a fictitious asteroid named 2021PDC.

20,"[Claim]:A Harvard professor lodged a patent in 2015 for a device which uses 5G to vibrate coronavirus particles.[Evidences]:A conspiracy-centric Facebook chat show claims US chemist Charles Lieber listed a patent for a device in 2015 that could vibrate coronavirus particles with 5G radiation. The claim is false. Experts say the patent has nothing to do with 5G or COVID-19, and the patent submission document makes no mention of either the virus or mobile phone network. In the Facebook video (screenshot here ) posted on July 28, COVID-19 conspiracy theorist Clay Clark says: “So 2015, Charles Lieber … he creates a patent for using 5G radiation to vibrate coronavirus particles from preset nanotubal containers,” (video mark 17min 34sec). Clark then quotes from the abstract of a patent application filed by a multi-national team including Lieber: “… the present invention is directed to electronic devices that can be injected or inserted into soft matter, such as biological tissue or polymeric matrixes. For example, the device may be passed through a syringe or a needle,” (video mark 18min 28sec). Clark says this proves the patent relates to COVID-19 and provides evidence of the use of electronic elements in mRNA vaccines , one of many conspiracy theories linking 5G to the pandemic, as seen here , here and here . The claims in the Facebook video have no scientific basis and experts say they are false. However, experts told AAP FactCheck this is not the case. Dr Vipul Agarwal , a biomedical engineering expert from UNSW, confirmed there was no basis to support the claim. “Based on my reading of the provided patent, it is my understanding that the patent has nothing to do with 5G technology or coronavirus. Further, this patent and the invented technology does not deal with Covid-19 vaccines,” Dr Agarwal said in an email. Dr Agarwal says the patent relates to using nanoscale electrical wires to assist in stimulating tissue and encouraging tissue regeneration. “The patent is about the development of nanoscale wire delivery methods for biomedical engineering-based tissue regeneration applications in tissues such as heart, muscle and brain. The nanoscale wire technology presented in this patent is aimed at electrically stimulating innate tissue which is in contact with the implanted nanoscale wires (which act as electrodes).” Professor Zdenka Kuncic , an expert on bio-nanoscience from the University of Sydney, also says there’s no link between the patent and either 5G or COVID-19. “The nanoscale wires the patent refers to do not have any possible relation to coronaviruses or 5G,” Prof Kuncic told AAP FactCheck in an email. “The nanowires are good conductors of electricity, so their application is mainly for bioelectronic devices (e.g. interfacing with the central nervous system, which works by sending electrical signals). They do not interact with electromagnetic radiation, which is a completely different phenomenon from electricity.” Experts say there is also no scientific evidence to support the claim there could be some connection between injectable nanowires and mRNA vaccines. AAP FactCheck contacted the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Monash University, which developed Australia’s first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Harry Al-Wassiti , a member of the COVID-19 vaccine team at Monash, says mRNA vaccines can’t be manipulated by electromagnetic interference as they are not made of conductive material. Dr Al-Wassiti said in order to achieve any electromagnetic conductance the wires or particles had to be “conductive (metal) or semi conductive”. “The mRNA vaccines are made of fat nanoparticles and are certainly not conductive,” he said in an email. Monash University researchers were pioneers in developing Australia’s first mRNA COVID-19 vaccine. Dr Al-Wassiti also said just because different particles were in the nanoscale, it doesn’t mean they all shared the same criteria. “”Nanoparticles’ is a name given merely to describe the size of a given particle. Natural milk for example is made of many natural fat nanoparticles,” he said. “Therefore, the claim that lipid mRNA vaccines somehow conduct 5G is NOT supported by any evidence or logic and goes against the basic laws of physics & chemistry.” Lieber is a prominent academic, renowned for his research into nanoscale materials and nanotechnology, with a particular focus on the application of nanotechnology in biology and medicine. The Harvard professor was arrested and charged in 2020 , following a US Department of Justice investigation into his links with Chinese researchers. A jury found him guilty of six charges in December 2021. Lieber has been prolific in the field of nanoscale technology. This patent is one of dozens he made while researching medical applications for the technology. AAP FactCheck previously debunked claims Lieber was arrested for manufacturing and selling coronavirus to China . The Verdict The claim an academic lodged a patent for using 5G to vibrate COVID-19 particles in 2015 is false. The patent makes no mention of 5G or coronaviruses. Experts told AAP FactCheck there is no scientific basis to support the idea nanowires can interact with 5G radiation or that the technology can be used to manipulate mRNA vaccine particles.

22,"[Claim]:Says David Dewhurst skipped nine candidate forums after announcing his U.S. Senate candidacy.[Evidences]:In an online video ad, U.S. Senate hopeful Ted Cruz likens Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst to the mythical chupacabra, saying his opponent -- the Republican frontrunner for the seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison after 2012 -- isn’t engaging with his opponents. Specifically, the narrator says: ""Since he entered the race on July 21, Dewhurst has skipped nine candidate forums.""Nine skips in nine forums?Cruz’s campaign passed us a list of nine Senate candidate forums that took place from July 21 through Sept. 15, 2011, with contact information for each event’s organizer. And in telephone interviews, forum organizers confirmed to us that Dewhurst did not appear at the gatherings.The Cruz campaign did not list an Aug. 28 event near Sugar Land, organized on behalf of U.S. Rep. Pete Olson, R-Houston; both the Dewhurst and Olson campaigns confirmed that the lieutenant governor and other GOP Senate candidates attended and were given five minutes each to speak.Thus, out of 10 forums between July 21 and Sept. 15, Dewhurst did not appear at nine.But is not showing up the same as skipping? We wondered. The organizers of seven forums told us Dewhurst’s campaign told them beforehand that Dewhurst would not participate.Exceptions: Marc Moffitt of the Denton County Republican Party said Dewhurst’s camp said he couldn’t come until after he declared his candidacy and then he announced his candidacy the same July night as the party’s forum, meaning he wasn’t even a candidate until then. And Toby Walker of the Waco Tea Party said she never heard from Dewhurst’s camp about her invitations to its Aug. 13, 2011, event. Walker said: ""It’s almost worse never to get a response. It’s like you’re not worthy.""Among other forum organizers, Dean Wright, who steered the July 30, 2011, Austin Tea Party forum, said the group set out a chair for Dewhurst in case he changed his mind. Robert ""Gonzo"" Gonzalez, overseeing an August forum for the Clear Lake Tea Party, said Dewhurst’s camp told him it was ""early in the campaign (to attend); I accepted that."" Capy Alexander of the Republican Women of Kerr County said Dewhurst’s camp sounded interested in its Aug. 19, 2011, event, but ""as it turns out, he was unable to come. I don’t know why.""Most of the nine organizers told us they did not view Dewhurst’s non-attendance as ""skipping."" Maria Acosta of the Central Texas 9-12 Project said she would better describe its Aug. 20, 2011, gathering as a ""lost opportunity.""However, Katrina Pierson of the Garland Tea Party said that even though Dewhurst’s campaign said before its Sept. 15, 2011, event that Dewhurst had a prior commitment, she still views him as skipping out because the group initially told him about its plans in May.The Dewhurst campaign responded by stating that Dewhurst was acting governor on six of the nine event dates listed by Cruz and had a previously scheduled Republican event on another.Dewhurst himself, after he held an Austin town hall event Oct. 3, told us, ""There is a whole other dynamic that folks are forgetting. Every week now for six weeks in a row, and maybe for another 13, 14 or 15 months, I’m the acting governor. ... I’m having a hard enough time just to go out and do some of our campaign events when we have both paperwork, responsibilities -- when we had the Bastrop (wild)fire, I was over there almost the whole week, totally consumed by it. So state business for me comes first.""Of the candidate forums, Dewhurst said: ""Quite frankly, I’m interested in getting our message out to the people, not necessarily spending a disproportional amount of time (with) the candidates talking to each other. … What I think is in the voters’ best interest is to hear from the candidates, and so that’s what we’re doing. We’re going to almost a different city every day.""Looking forward, he said, that ""as we can, we’re going to go to a forum or so every month."" This month, he said, he plans to appear at an Oct. 21 candidate forum hosted by the Spirit of Freedom Republican Women PAC in Sugar Land.Our take: Dewhurst did not appear at nine forums, eight of them after the night he announced his candidacy. But it’s a mite questionable to say he outright skipped the events. In most cases, his campaign said beforehand Dewhurst wasn’t going to appear.We rate Cruz’s statement Mostly True.",True,Conflicting

Rock Reflections also added their own caption above the meme, which read, ""While Chuck may have that 'What the…..?' stare, it looks like John has that 'Oh crap, I forgot to tell him my wife was here' look on his face."" Was the still frame with Berry's wide-eyed reaction actually from a different part of the song? Was this meme in any way misleading? A check of the video showed that this meme was indeed a faithful representation of the moment. Beginning at the 16:05 mark below, readers can see that Berry's eyes go wide upon the first sounds that Ono made, while the band plays his hit, ""Memphis, Tennessee."" Lennon appeared to slightly react as well, looking slightly to Ono's direction, but not with quite the facial expression shown by Berry. At the 17:06 and 18:05 marks in the video, Ono can once again be seen singing into the microphone. However, she isn't audible for at least part of those two subsequent moments, but can barely be heard just as the song finishes. One YouTube user commented, ""Respect to the person who switched Yoko's mic off. They should be found and put in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame."" It's unclear if the microphone was truly switched off. Nevertheless, Ono could not be heard, at least not loudly, after the first bout of ""screeching.""

Republicans and Democrats either want credit for any progress being made, or want to blame the other side for any lack of progress. Sen. Michael Lee, a Republican from Wilmington, is gearing up for re-election against Harper Peterson, a former Wilmington mayor.He tweetedon Aug. 28 that ""teacher pay has increased under Republican leadership every year for the past 5 years. In fact, even according to the national teacher’s unions own rankings, NC ranked number 2 in the U.S. for fastest rising teacher pay 2016-2017."" Did teacher pay increase over the past five years? Here’s the average teacher salary from the past five years: 2013-14: $44,990 2014-15: $47,819 2015-16: $47,985 2016-17: $49,837 2017-18: $50,861 Those teacher salaries also include supplements, but those are provided by the local district and not the General Assembly. The numbers do not take into consideration any rise in health care premiums, cost-of-living or other expenses. The average rate of inflation over the course of these years was 2.3 percent, based on information fromthe Bureau of Labor Statistics. At first glance, it does appear that teachers got a pay raise every year. However, thesalary schedulesfrom the North Carolina Department of Instruction tell a slightly different story. Teachers with 35 years of experience were being paid $52,150 in the2013-14 school year.In the2014-15 school year, the base salary for teachers with 25 years of experience or more dropped to $50,000. The 2016""Held Harmless"" statutemade sure no teacher would make less in 2016-17 than in 2014-15. So, those teachers did not receive a pay cut in the following years. The average pay did increase every year after the 2013-14 school year. In the2017-18 academic year, teachers with 35 years of experience were paid $51,300. Basically, teachers who reach 35 years of experience today because they are now included in the overall ""25-year-plus"" category. (Clarification: An earlier version of this story said teachers received pay cuts following the 2013-14 academic year. However, we neglected to factor in the ""Held Harmless"" statute that prevents teacher pay cuts.) It’s the same story for teachers with 36 years of experience. They were paid $53,180 in the2013-14 academic year, but teachers who reach 36 years of experience would’ve been paid $50,000 in the 2014-15 academic year. In the2017-18 academic year, these teachers were paid $51,300 as well. The same""Held Harmless"" statutehas been included in the 2018-19 budgets so no teacher gets a pay cut. In addition, teachers with up to four years were the only ones to get a base salary increase in the2015-16 academic year. They were paid $33,000 in 2014-15, and then paid $35,000 in 2015-16. In the following years, first-year teachers did not see an increase to their base salary. It stayed at $35,000. How fast did teacher pay increase? North Carolina wasranked secondin having the fastest teacher pay raise in 2016-17 nationally, according to theNational Education Association. This is where Lee’s legislative assistant, Emily Barnes, says Lee got his information. However, that hasn’t always been the case. In the2013-14academic year, North Carolina was ranked 48th for percentage change in average teacher salary, with a -1.6 percent change. The state also ranked 41st in the2015-16academic year for teacher pay raises with a 0.3 percent change. North Carolina did rank first in teacherpay raise in 2014-15with a 6.3 percent change from the previous year. Our ruling Teachers did get a salary increase in each of the past five years under Republican leadership. However, despite the ""Held Harmless"" statute, teachers who reach 25 years of experience or more today would not make as much as they would have in 2013-14. That’s the main wrinkle in Lee’s claim. North Carolina ranked second in fastest-rising teacher pay in 2016-17, though the ranking wasn’t consistent over the years. We rate this claim Mostly True.

25,"[Claim]:Video shows Narendra Modi criticising Pakistan government in 2023[Evidences]:The video was shared by Pakistani opposition lawmaker Azam Khan Swati to his 160,000 Twitter followers on January 11. The clip shows Modi boasting that India has ""beaten out all of Pakistan's false bravado"". ""I've forced them to carry a bowl and go around the world [to beg],"" he says in Hindi. Swati, a member of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, claimed the footage showed Modi mocking the shaky alliance that came to power after PTI leader Imran Khan was ousted as prime minister. He tweeted in Urdu: ""To those who facilitated the regime change. Can you hear what India's Modi is saying about Pakistan? If there is no honour in you then at least have some shame? ""People of Pakistan: this is why the only way to save this country is through Imran Khan's trufe freedom."" Pakistan has been gripped by political turmoil since Khan was ousted in a no-confidence vote in April. The former leader insists he was overthrown by a US-led ""regime change"" conspiracy -- which Washington strongly denies -- and has rallied mass demonstrations pressing the government to call a snap election. He vowed to fight on with his ""last drop of blood"" after he was shot in an assassination attempt at a rally in November. Pro-PTI Facebook pages shared the video of Modi speaking here and here and it also circulated on Twitter here, here and here. A reverse image search of keyframes from the clip found it in a longer video posted on YouTube on April 21, 2019 by Indian newspaper The Economic Times. The clip in the misleading posts corresponds to the 02:09 mark of The Economic Times' video. India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also shared a video of Modi's full speech on YouTube on the same day, where he can be heard making the same comments at the 34:32 mark. In the full speech, which Modi gave in Rajasthan while campaigning for reelection in 2019, he boasted that his government had called Pakistan's ""nuclear bluff"". At the time, tensions surged between the nuclear-armed rivals after India said it launched air strikes against militants in Pakistan's territory. ""India has stopped getting scared of Pakistan's threats. Every other day they say, 'we have a nuclear button.' What do we have then? Have we kept it for Diwali?"" Modi said, referring to a Hindu festival when fireworks are set off. He added: ""Brothers and sisters, we've beaten out all of Pakistan's false bravado.

27,"[Claim]:Says there have been 50 million abortions since Roe v. Wade was decided.[Evidences]:Gov. Rick Perry marked the 38th anniversary of what he called ""the tragedy"" of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision by speaking to fellow abortion opponents at the Jan. 22 Texas Rally for Life outside the Capitol building. Perry said that since the 1973 decision, which established abortion as a constitutional right, ""50 million, 50 million children have lost their chances. That is a catastrophic number."" PolitiFact Texas readers asked us to check Perry's statement. But before diving in, we noted two issues with Perry's use of ""children"" -- a flash point in the political, moral and scientific national debate over abortion. One, abortion rights supporters dispute calling unborn fetuses ""children."" Second, an unknown share of the 50 million aborted pregnancies referenced by Perry would not have resulted in live children, due to the natural risk of miscarriages and stillbirths. For our inquiry, we focused on the number of U.S. abortions since Roe was decided. The Roe v. Wade ruling, issued Jan. 22, 1973, struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and held that the right to privacy ""is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy."" It said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. It noted that viability ""is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks."" After fetal viability, the court said, states could limit abortions provided that their policies met certain requirements, including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to approve further restrictions. During the early 1960s, every state except Pennsylvania allowed abortions when needed to protect a woman's life, according to a March 2003 article published by the universally respected Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. At the time Roe was decided, 17 states allowed abortions in certain other situations such as when pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. In 1972, the year before the Roe ruling, about 587,000 legal abortions were reported to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a 2005 CDC report. And since 1973? Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to a January 2010 report from the National Right to Life Committee, a Washington-based group that opposes abortion, that says about 52 million abortions took place from 1973 through 2009. According to the report, the group arrived at the total using figures from the Guttmacher Institute for 1973 through 2005; estimating a number for the next four years; and finally adding 3 percent to account for under-reporting. The National Right to Life publication says 3 percent is the under-reporting rate estimated by Guttmacher. Using a similar methodology, National Right to Life has since updated its numbers. The new report says that more than 53 million abortions took place from 1973 through 2010. Rachel Jones, a senior research associate at Guttmacher, told us the institute doesn't adjust its numbers — which are estimates based on surveys of facilities where abortions are performed, including hospitals and clinics — for under-reporting. She said a 1994 Guttmacher study had found that some small facilities weren't included in the institute's survey, which indicated that the number of abortions in 1992 was actually 3 percent to 4 percent more than reported. Our attempts to reach officials at National Right to Life were unsuccessful. Next, we sought the most up-to-date abortion data from Guttmacher. Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind provided us with a 2011 report that includes annual data on abortions from 1973 through 2008. The total: 49.3 million. We also sought abortion numbers from other sources. Data from the CDC indicate that there were 37.8 million abortions from 1973 through 2006. However, according to the CDC's website, states are not required to report abortion information to the agency, so in some years, the numbers are incomplete. For example, the CDC's 2006 data do not include information on abortions in California, Louisiana or New Hampshire. Representatives of abortion rights organizations Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Texas told us that the Guttmacher Institute is the best source for this information. Summing up: Perry's statement indicating that there have been 50 million abortions in the United States since 1973 appears to be on target. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that there were 49.3 million abortions in the U.S. through 2008 — 700,000 shy of 50 million. Considering that Guttmacher says there were more than 1 million abortions in both 2007 and 2008, it's reasonable to conclude that the United States has reached the 50 million mark.

28,"[Claim]:The “American Journal of Medicine admit their stand on [hydroxychloroquine] was wrong“; it “published evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective for preventing COVID-19“[Evidences]:CLAIM The “American Journal of Medicine admit their stand on [hydroxychloroquine] was wrong“; it “published evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective for preventing COVID-19“ more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Jim Hoft, Gateway Pundit, 28 Jan. 2021 DETAILS Inaccurate: The American Journal of Medicine didn’t endorse hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 patients. Scientific journals publish findings, but don’t issue treatment recommendations. The study published in The American Journal of Medicine is a review of previous literature that doesn’t provide new data or an analysis to support the use of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19 patients. KEY TAKE AWAY No scientific evidence demonstrates that hydroxychloroquine is useful for preventing or treating COVID-19, despite social media posts and articles claiming otherwise. Large, randomized, controlled clinical trials in several countries found that hydroxychloroquine doesn't produce any benefits in terms of mortality rate or clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients. Due to the lack of benefits and risk of heart rhythm problems, public health authorities recommend against using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients outside of clinical trials. FULL CLAIM: “After 440,000 americans are dead, Facebook and American Journal of Medicine admit their stand on [hydroxychloroquine] was wrong”; ""The American Journal of Medicine published evidence that hydroxychloroquine is effective for preventing COVID-19“; “Peer-reviewed journal reports hydroxychloroquine can reduce mortality rates in covid-19 patients” REVIEW In late January 2021, social media posts and articles claimed that hydroxychloroquine was effective for the early treatment of COVID-19 patients based on a scientific publication in The American Journal of Medicine. The claim went viral on social media platforms, mainly shared by groups opposing lockdowns and outlets such as Gateway Pundit, Mercola, and One America News Network (OAN), which previously published health misinformation about COVID-19 (examples here, here, and here). Such articles and posts received more than 110,000 interactions on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, according to the social media analytics tool CrowdTangle. To support their claim, these posts cite the same article by McCullough et al.[1], published in the January 2021 issue of The American Journal of Medicine. Some posts interpreted this to mean that the American Journal of Medicine “recommended” hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 (here). Others claimed that the journal “admit[s] their stand on hydroxychloroquine was wrong” (here). However, those claims are inaccurate. Joseph S. Alpert, editor-in-chief of The American Journal of Medicine, explained to Newsweek that “this article does not mean the journal recommended this therapy”: “We have also published articles from other authorities that said don’t use [hydroxychloroquine] … We are a scientific journal and do not push or recommend any specific thing. The authors do that”. Rather than issuing recommendations, scientific journals publish articles where the authors might recommend for or against the use of a particular treatment. For example, The American Journal of Medicine previously published an editorial in which the authors recommend against the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 patients, which also doesn’t mean that it endorsed this recommendation. Many articles and posts cite the article by McCullough et al. as a “study”, claiming “the study found that immediate use of hydroxychloroquine, while the patient was still at home, showed significant benefits”. This article focuses on early treatment strategies that can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in ambulatory COVID-19 patients. Given the lack of clinical trials and specific guidelines for the early treatment of COVID-19 patients, the authors propose several strategies and recommendations. However, the publication by McCullough et al. doesn’t provide new evidence on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients, contrary to what many social media posts claim. “Studies” or “research articles” are publications that report newly collected research data and include specific sections describing the methods, results, and conclusions of the research. Instead, the article by McCullough et al. makes general recommendations for treating ambulatory COVID-19 patients based on previous evidence. In fact, the article’s summary highlights the lack of scientific evidence on the topic: “In the absence of clinical trials and guidelines, with hospitalizations and mortality mounting, it is prudent to deploy treatment for COVID-19 based on pathophysiological principles”. Therefore, the claim that the publication by McCullough et al. provides scientific evidence of the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients is inaccurate. As Health Feedback explained in this earlier review, large-scale clinical trials in several countries found no beneficial effect of hydroxychloroquine in terms of viral shedding, disease severity, or mortality among COVID-19 patients[2,3]. Clinical trials also found that hydroxychloroquine was not beneficial for preventing the disease[4,5]. In April 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cautioned against the unsupervised use of hydroxychloroquine due to potential cardiac toxicity. In June 2020, the agency revoked the Emergency Use Authorization for hydroxychloroquine in hospital settings. Public health authorities, including the U.S. National Institutes of Health, also recommend against using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients as it shows no benefit and may cause heart rhythm problems in a small proportion of patients. Some articles claim that the number of COVID-19 deaths “could have been lowered significantly if hydroxychloroquine use would have been promoted in the U.S”. However, these claims are unsubstantiated. Given that hydroxychloroquine has shown no beneficial effect in COVID-19 patients, the scientific evidence doesn’t support the claim that widespread use of the drug could have saved lives. In summary, The American Journal of Medicine didn’t endorse hydroxychloroquine treatment for COVID-19 patients. The journal simply published a review in which the authors recommended general early treatment strategies based on previous research. Large-scale clinical trials indicate that hydroxychloroquine doesn’t prevent or treat COVID-19. The absence of benefits, coupled with the fact that hydroxychloroquine may cause heart rhythm problems in some patients, led public health authorities to recommend against using hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19 patients outside of clinical trials. Additional notes Peter McCullough, the first author of the review in The American Journal of Medicine, was one of the four expert witnesses testifying in a November 2020 Senate hearing held by the U.S. Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. There, McCullough advocated for the early treatment of COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine. This hearing, and a second one held in December, were both criticized for promoting the use of unproven drugs and the spread of misinformation. REFERENCES",False,False
29,"[Claim]:Says Barack Obama ""promised"" gasoline at $2.50 a gallon.[Evidences]:Lenny Curry, head of the Republican Party of Florida, said President Barack Obama is going to have a hard time winning Florida, citing gas prices and federal spending as just two reasons.""Obama’s going to come here and spend a lot of money, but President Obama's going to have to run on his record. He's going to have to run on what he promised,"" Curry said in an interview on Bay News 9’s ""Political Connections"" on March 4, 2012.""He promised gasoline I believe at $2.50. When he took office it was about $1.68. We know it's well above $2.50 now. He promised he would cut the deficit in half. We know what's happened there,"" Curry said.Curry went on to praise Florida Gov. Rick Scott for job creation, saying that showed a clear contrast with the Obama administration.Curry, a businessman from Jacksonville, became head of the state party in September 2011. He was the hand-picked successor of party chairman Dave Bitner, who died after a fight with Lou Gehrig's disease.We wondered if Curry was accurate in describing Obama’s promises to voters, so we decided to check it out. Here at PolitiFact, we take a special interest in the campaign promises of elected officials. We collected Obama’s promises for our Obameterand Scott’s promises for the Scott-O-Meter.We asked the Republican Party of Florida for evidence to back up Curry’s claims about Obama’s promises on gas prices, but we didn’t hear back.Curry said that gas prices were at $1.68 when Obama took office, and on that point, he’s largely correct. The national city average for regular unleaded at the beginning of 2009 was $1.79, so that’s in the ballpark, considering flexibility for regional variations.But what did Obama promise on gas prices? Here, we’ll look at whether Obama promised gasoline prices at $2.50 a gallon. (In a separate report, we’ll look at whether he promised to cut the deficit in half.)Back in the summer of 2008, Obama said the federal government should immediately consider energy rebates and releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. For the long term, though, he had other ideas for energy policy, such as investing in renewable fuels and making cars more fuel efficient. (See all of Obama’s energy promises here.)Obama has broken one significant gas-related promise: to enact a ""windfall profits"" tax on oil companies. In 2008, he said the new tax could pay for energy rebates to American families. We gave that a Promise Broken on our Obameter back in March 2011. Aides said the tax was not necessary after gas prices fell from their 2008 highs. We have yet to hear of any moves to revive the plan.The closest we could find to a promise on gas prices were comments Obama made in Winston-Salem, N.C. in April 2008: ""I want to invest that money in clean, affordable, renewable energy sources like wind power, and solar power, and biofuels, so that we're not talking about high fuel prices next summer or the next summer after that or the summer after that.""But that’s a far cry from pledging a particular price.We did find one current candidate making such a pledge: Republican Newt Gingrich said he would keep gas prices at $2.50 or less if elected president.""I've developed a program for American energy so no future president will ever bow to a Saudi king again and so every American can look forward to $2.50 a gallon gasoline,"" he said at a CNN debate.Analysts, though, are dubious of the power of any president to affect short-term gas prices.""What can you do to change the market in the short term? The answer is not much,"" said James Bartis of the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit research group that provides independent policy analysis. ""It takes many years to open up a new oil field, to prepare and get production from a new oilfield. Generally, I would say a decade is the minimum.""Obama recently mocked Republicans for promising lower gas prices in a speech in Miami. ""It’s the easiest thing in the world to make phony election-year promises about lower gas prices. What’s harder is to make a serious, sustained commitment to tackle a problem,"" he said.Our rulingObama has discussed the need for the country to achieve energy independence through reduced consumption and more renewable energy sources. At times he connected those policies to lower gas prices for families. But he never promised a particular price point and certainly not $2.50 a gallon. We rate Curry’s statement False.

30,"[Claim]:Says salaries and benefits for Wisconsin state employee comprised 8.5 percent of the 2009-2011 state budget.[Evidences]:When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker took aim at public employees with his now-famous budget-repair bill, he used stark rhetoric to make a case for curtailing collective bargaining and making employees pay more for health care and pensions. ""I don't have anything to negotiate. We are broke in this state,"" Walker said in February 2011, making a claim we ruled False. ""We have been broke for years. People have ignored that for years, and it's about time somebody stood up and told the truth. The truth is: We don't have money to offer.""A week later, state Rep. Mark Pocan -- who drew a False from us for claiming Walker’s $3.6 billion estimate of the state budget deficit was ""bogus"" -- took aim at the Republican governor.In a Feb. 19, 2011 blog post titled ""Scott Walker’s top ten lies,"" Pocan tried to shred Walker’s rationale for the budget-repair bill, which would reduce the deficit but is now tied up in court.The Madison Democrat, a 13-year lawmaker, had this to say about what he labeled lie No. 9:""Walker has said that our budget problems are largely due to employee wages. Not even close, Governor. Total salaries and compensation in the last budget were 8.5 percent of the entire state budget.""Pocan’s claim got national exposure when it was re-posted two days later on the liberal DailyKos.com, a leading political website.Although the claim was made weeks ago, it remains relevant. How much state employees cost taxpayers is central to the debate over their compensation and collective bargaining powers -- and we still get reader requests to check it out.So we did.Pocan’s assertion that employee wages and benefits comprise 8.5 percent of the state budget contained an asterisk, leading readers to a footnote. The footnote said the 8.5 percent figure came from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, but that the figure excluded the University of Wisconsin System and the Department of Corrections, which includes the state prisons.Those are two massive state operations.So, right off the bat, Pocan’s claim is dubious. If employees in major departments are not included, it’s going to make the overall cost of wages and benefits seem smaller.Indeed, the footnote -- which did not explain why the two areas were excluded -- said that when the UW System and corrections are considered, employee compensation costs make up 17.7 percent of the state budget.We wanted to see the Legislative Fiscal Bureau report that Pocan cited as his source, but Pocan refused to provide it. The bureau also would not provide the report, saying it was confidential to the lawmaker who requested it.The Legislature Fiscal Bureau is generally regarded as the gold standard in financial matters of the state. But without seeing the bureau’s report, we don’t know what information it was asked to generate and we can’t see how it arrived at the two percentages cited by Pocan.So, we sought out other sources.Dale Knapp, research director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, cited the state’s 2010 Annual Fiscal Report, which shows that ""general purpose revenue,"" or the general fund budget, was $12.8 billion.He also cited the state’s 2010 personal services and fringe benefit report, which showed that spending on salaries and benefits was $2.22 billion.That means salaries and benefits were 17.3 percent of the state budget. That’s more than double Pocan’s 8.5 percent claim (though nearly the same as the 17.7 percent figure cited in his footnote.)Since Pocan’s blog post attacked Walker, we also asked the governor’s office to weigh in. It provided a memo issued by the state budget office, which is part of Walker’s administration. The memo was issued to ""interested parties"" on Feb. 9, 2011, two days before Walker introduced his budget-repair bill.The memo said employee compensation costs were $2.11 billion, nearly the same as Knapp’s $2.22 billion. However, the memo compared the employee costs to the ""state operations"" budget, which is only $3.67 billion, to conclude that employee costs make up 60 percent of that budget.What’s going on here?The compensation numbers are being compared against two different measures of state spending.State operations covers only the UW System, corrections, the courts and other state departments -- in other words, direct services provided by state employees. The overall budget includes some $9 billion more that the state takes in and distributes to local governments, schools and individuals.We asked two other government finance experts for guidance.Milwaukee County Auditor Jerome Heer said the method used to calculate the 17 percent figure is reliable because it takes into account not only what the state spends to provide direct services but also what it sends to local governments and to individuals. City of Milwaukee Deputy Comptroller Mike Daun said there is value in the method used to calculate the 60 percent figure in that it relates only to the employee costs as a percentage of direct services.However, both agreed Pocan’s 8.5 percent figure does not reflect the share of the state budget that goes to salaries and benefits.Let’s sum up.Pocan claimed in a blog post that salaries and benefits for state employees comprise 8.5 percent of the state budget. He did not provide evidence for the figure. In a footnote, Pocan acknowledged that two huge state operations -- the university system and corrections -- were not included, and that if they were, the figure is about 17 percent.The Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance agreed with the 17 percent, while the state budget office argued that the figure is 60 percent. Experts said the two figures are different ways to express what employees cost. But everyone agreed that Pocan’s 8.5 percent -- the main number he used, which was repeated elsewhere -- is not accurate.We rate Pocan’s statement False. (Editor's note: On April 25, 2011, the day after this item was published, Rep. Mark Pocan wrote in a blog post that we incorrectly stated in the item he refused to provide a memo that he relied on in making his claim about employee compensation.We have searched for the email on this end, including having the Journal Sentinel’s IT department check all filters for an email sent at the time in question, and have no record of receiving it.Our practice is to link to all of the source documents we use on items and would have done so with the memo Pocan requested from the fiscal bureau. The document in question simply reiterates the numbers that were cited. Thus, they do not affect the False ruling -- which Rep. Pocan has not challenged.Here is a summary of our efforts to reach Rep. Pocan for his input on this item:We emailed him April 8, 2011, asking for evidence he had to support his claim. We didn't get a reply, so we emailed him again April 12, and then emailed and called him on April 14. In the phone conversation, Pocan said he relied on a Legislative Fiscal Bureau memo in making his claim, but said that he would not send us the memo. We sent another email the same day, asking Pocan to reconsider.That is all reflected in the email Rep. Pocan said he sent to us, which is linked in his follow up post on his blog.

Verdict: False

The Wech Baghtu airstrike, which occurred in November 2008, occurred under the Bush administration.

Fact Check:

The U.S. has used drones to carry out airstrikes against militant targets since at least 2002,ProPublicareported. TheCouncil on Foreign Relationsestimates that more than 500 drone strikes took place during the Obama administration alone, with most targeting Yemen, Pakistan and Somalia.

Aviral imageof a screen grabbed tweet alleges that Obama ordered a deadly drone strike on an Afghan wedding in Wech Baghtu. Theoriginal tweet, which has more than 2,900 likes, uses the alleged Obama-era strike to justify President Donald Trump’s ordering of the drone strike that killed top Iranian Gen. Qasem Soleimani.

“I’m old enough to remember when Obama droned a wedding in Wech Baghtu Afghanistan to take out some low level insurgents, killing 23 children, 10 women and wounding 27 others, not a damn word from congress,” states thetweet. “#Soleimani is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of US troops, so STFU.”

However, the post gets the administration wrong. The airstrike, which occurred on Nov. 3, 2008, actually happened during the Bush administration, according toThe New York Times. It’s unclear whether a drone carried out the airstrike, but it did kill 33 women and children, reportedNBC News.

Obama didn’t take office untilJan. 20, 2009, more than two months after that strike took place.(RELATED: Is The US Spending $50 Billion A Year In Afghanistan?)

35,"[Claim]:""Without ethanol, gas prices would be at least 15% higher. With gas at four bucks, that means you’re saving 12 bucks on a 20 gallon fill up.""[Evidences]:The latest run-up in gas prices, to the $4 a gallon range, is causing some Wisconsin drivers to change their travel habits.Gas prices have slid back since touching a recent high of $4.13 a gallon on May 4, 2011, according to Wisconsingasprices.com. When Memorial Day weekend began, they were in the neighborhood of $3.88 a gallon, though prices varied some throughout the state.But that’s still a big jump since the beginning of 2011, when drivers were paying around $3 a gallon for regular unleaded.With the pain at the pump setting in, the corn growers and ethanol industry are trying to make the best of a bad situation. In a radio ad, the Wisconsin Corn Growers Association tells drivers that prices would be even higher without ethanol in the mix.One version of the ad uses a fake host, ""Filler Up Phil"" who takes calls from people concerned about high gas prices. He tells one caller that ethanol adds to the nation’s fuel supply, and tells another that the fuel additive helps save consumers money.""Without ethanol, gas prices would be at least 15 percent higher,"" the fake host says. ""With gas at four bucks, that means you’re saving 12 bucks on a 20 gallon fill-up.""That’ll get your attention, no matter what kind of car you drive. It’s a specific claim but -- as with political ads -- carries a broader message: Ethanol is a boon for your wallet.So, let’s husk it.First, a little background.Most gasoline is blended with 10 percent ethanol, a fuel made from corn. That’s part of federal legislation pushed by the corn growers, the ethanol industry and renewable fuels supporters that seeks to boost the amount of ethanol we burn in our cars. The industry is encouraged -- and propped up -- by a controversial $6 billion package of tax credits, production mandates and tariffs.A key argument in favor of ethanol is that each gallon burned means less oil that needs to be imported.The federal law seeks to boost ethanol production over time. The goal is to reach 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels in the U.S. market by 2022. Production was about 13 billion gallons in 2010, according to the Energy Information Administration.The effort is driven by a variety of tax breaks and incentives, including a 45 cents a gallon tax credit paid to refineries and a 54 cent a gallon tariff on imported ethanol. The feds also require ethanol to be blended with conventional gas, and since last year when demand fell, they’ve come up with new ways to boost ethanol consumption.But ethanol subsidies are under attack on a variety of fronts, including those who see the system as a wasteful industry handout. The Wall Street Journal editorial board in January launched a major attack on the fuel -- and ethanol backer GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich.The newspaper said four of every 10 rows of corn in the U.S. are grown for ethanol, an argument that fed complaints that a food crop was being wasted in our gas tanks. Still others condemn ethanol’s poor fuel efficiency and pollution impacts. And others blame ethanol for driving up the cost of food.So, what about the claim in the ad?The group based its claim on a 2008 report from the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University. The researchers found that ethanol reduces the cost of gasoline by about 40 cents a gallon.They issued an updated report in April 2011 that factored in 2010 data for oil prices and increased production of ethanol. That report delivered an even more startling conclusion: Ethanol cuts gas prices by 89 cents a gallon.It’s even higher if you live in the Midwest -- $1.37 a gallon, the new report says.And the latest report from the center goes one step further. The researchers looked at what would happen if ethanol production stopped immediately. A gallon of gas would cost up to $7.20, or $144 for that 20 gallon fill up.So when you do the math, the savings is even higher than described in the ad.But there is another side to the issue -- one that carries its own costs.The ethanol industry is supported by those aforementioned tax incentives. And federal law requires the industry to brew more, and burn more.Including all of those factors, the Natural Resources Defense Council says it costs taxpayers $4.18 to produce each gallon of ethanol. Oil companies will be forced to buy more of the fuel that taxpayers have paid to brew, the group argues.There’s also the question about burning food for fuel, and the impact that ethanol has on food prices. More corn burned means your cornflakes cost more.Iowa State University economist Bruce Babcock last year estimated that ethanol policies drive up the cost of food by at least 1.5 percent.""I don't see why we can really justify subsidies, when all that does is raises cost of producing food,"" Babcock told National Public Radio.So where does that leave us (other than relieved we’re not paying $7 a gallon for gas)?The corn growers say we’re paying less at the pump, thanks to ethanol being blended into gasoline. The study they cite provides support for the claim -- indeed, an updated version suggests the radio ad actually low balls the savings per fill-up.But there is a cost to taxpayers to support the ethanol program -- $6 billion a year -- which goes unmentioned in the ad. And using food for fuel drives up the cost of your grocery bill, even as the price at the pump is offset by the program. And there are pollution and fuel efficiency concerns tied to the additive. Those are also unmentioned.So, while generally true, the claim leaves out important information. On our gauge that’s a Half True.",Conflicting,True

38,"[Claim]:SaysRuben Kihuen ""only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 he introduced"" during the 2015 legislative session.[Evidences]:Nevada Democrats are champing at the bit to take on first-term Republican U.S. Rep. Cresent Hardy. Hardy represents just one of a handful of Republican-held House seats that lean Democratic, and his is widely considered one of the most ""flippable"" seats in 2016. The district includes parts of North Las Vegas and stretches across southern Nevada. Several high-profile Democrats have announced their candidacy, and attacks are already flying in one of the most-watched and well-funded congressional races in the country. Former Assemblywoman Lucy Flores, who made waves after endorsing Sen. Bernie Sanders for president, has aggressively gone after State Sen. Ruben Kihuen, who is generally considered the frontrunner after gaining the support of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and the state’s powerful Culinary Union. At a January candidate forum in rural Pahrump, Nev, Flores portrayed Kihuen (pronounced KEY-WIN) as an ineffective lawmaker and attacked his record, including a signature bill passed in 2015 expanding low-income college scholarships. ""Frankly, he only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 that he introduced,"" she said. ""And the college bill was actually primarily sponsored by the Republican majority leader, so of course the Republican majority leader wasn’t going to let that bill fail."" We thought her claim merited fact-checking. Kihuen’s legislative record has been scrutinized since 2011, when the Las Vegas Sun pointed out he was one of two lawmakers who did not introduce a single bill in the legislative session. The Flores campaign pointed to that article, and provided a list of bills that Kihuen introduced during the 2015 legislative session as evidence of Kihuen’s ineffectiveness. (The Nevada Legislature only meets for six months every two years.) Flores’ allegation is mostly on the mark. Of the eight bills introduced by Kihuen in 2015, only one was ultimately signed into law — a bill allowing the county commissioners in Las Vegas to propose up to a $14 fee on marriage licenses to promote marriage tourism. But she misidentifies the co-sponsor of arguably Kihuen’s biggest legislative accomplishment. (Flores owned up to the mistake after the forum.) Kihuen worked closely with Republican Assistant Majority Leader Ben Kieckhefer in passing the state’s first need-based college scholarship program. The ""Silver State Opportunity Grant Program"" allocates $5 million over two years for low-income students enrolled in Nevada community colleges and universities, and more than 670 students are signed up. Kieckhefer said the bill originated from a college affordability summit hosted by the two before the legislative session, and he credited Kihuen for helping push the legislation through with minimal opposition. ""Ruben and I were partners on this bill, and I know he worked it hard on his side,"" he said. Flores’s comments also strike at a larger issue - finding the best way to measure legislative effectiveness. Kihuen’s campaign manager, Dave Chase, said because Democrats were in the minority during the session, it makes more sense to measure effectiveness by what Kihuen was able to prevent from happening. ""The real work comes in committee and on the floor, where Ruben, while in the minority, fought to kill reckless Republican bills that would have ended collective bargaining, overtime pay and rolled back key voting rights all while passing 19 bills he sponsored,"" he wrote in an email. ""Ms. Flores should ask the 700 students going to college right now thanks to Ruben's work if he was effective last session."" Kihuen servedas part of the leadership team for the 10-person Democratic caucus, and Senate Democratic head Aaron Ford praised Kihuen’s work during the legislative session. As for the critical 2011 article in the Sun, Damore said he was ""hesitant"" to lend much credence to a five-year old article and recommended looking at Kihuen’s more recent legislative accomplishments. A full list is here. Six of the ten bills introduced by Kihuen during the 2013 session were eventually signed into law. UNLV political science professor David Damore said it’s difficult to measure legislative effectiveness based solely on the raw numbers of bills proposed and laws that are passed. ""Certainly factors such as majority or minority status as well as seniority play into passage, and of course not every bill that gets passed should be become law, and not all that do have an equal impact,"" he said in an email. Nevada lawmakers are also limited as to the number of bills they can propose during the session, so legislators can’t propose dozens of bills to pad their numbers. Our ruling Flores said Kihuen ""only managed in the minority to get one bill passed out of the eight to 10 he introduced"" during the 2015 legislative session. Flores is technically accurate in her criticism. But the insinuation that he was an ineffective legislator because of that ignores some important context about the realities of being in the minority party and his role in passing other legislation behind the scenes. Her claim is accurate but needs additional context. We rate the claim Mostly True.",True,True
39,"[Claim]:“We saved 2 million people” from dying of COVID-19.[Evidences]:President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed to have saved 2 million lives from COVID-19 through his actions to combat the disease. He made the assertion again during the NBC News town hall on Oct. 15 that replaced the second presidential debate. ""But we were expected to lose, if you look at the original charts from original doctors who are respected by everybody, 2,200,000 people,"" Trump said. ""We saved 2 million people,"" he added. He mentioned the same ballpark figure during a Sept. 15 ABC News town hall and posted a tweet about it on Oct. 13. Others in the Trump administration have also pointed to the 2.2 million figure. Vice President Mike Pence referenced it during the vice presidential debate on Oct. 7. So did Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar during a Sept. 20 ""Meet the Press"" television interview. Where did this number come from? And is there any truth to the idea that Trump is responsible for saving 2 million lives from COVID-19? Since Trump continues to use it to claim success, we decided to look into it. The White House and the Trump presidential campaign did not respond to our request for evidence supporting the idea that roughly 2 million lives were spared because of the administration's actions. The figureappears to have been mentioned by the president first during a March 29 White House coronavirus task force press briefing, when Trump and Dr. Deborah Birx, task force coordinator, explained they were asking Americans to stay home from mid-March through the end of April, because mathematical models showed 1.6 million to 2.2 million people could die from COVID-19. The warning stemmed from a paper authored by Neil Ferguson, an epidemiology professor at Imperial College London. He modeled how COVID-19 can spread through a population in different scenarios, including what would happen if no interventions were put in place and people continued to live their daily lives as normal. In the paper, Ferguson wrote, ""In total, in an unmitigated epidemic, we would predict approximately 510,000 deaths in [Great Britain] and 2.2 million in the US."" Ferguson did not respond to our request to talk through the study with him. But in a July email interview with HuffPost, he said Trump’s boastof having saved2million lives isn’t true, because the pandemic isn’t over. Andrea Bertozzi, a mathematics professor at UCLA, said it was important to remember the 2.2 million figure was derived from a modeling scenario that would almost certainly never happen — which is that neither the government nor individuals would change their behavior at all in light of COVID-19. The study didn’t mean to say 2.2 million people were absolutely going to die, but rather to say, ""Hold on, if we let this thing run its course, bad things could happen,"" said Bertozzi. Indeed, the results from the study did cause government leaders in both the U.S. and the United Kingdom to implement social distancing measures. Experts also pointed out that the U.S. has the highest COVID-19 death toll of any country in the world — more than 220,000 people — and among the highest death rates, according to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. ""I don’t think we can say we’ve prevented 2 million deaths, because people are still dying,"" said Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. In some instances when using the 2 million estimate, Trump and others in his administration cited the China travel restrictions for saving lives, while other times they’ve credited locking down the economy. We’ll explore whether either statement holds water. Trump implemented travel restrictions for some people traveling from China beginning Feb. 2 and fromEurope on March 11. But experts say and reports show the restrictions don’t appear to have had much effect because they were put in place too late and had too many holes. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first cases of coronavirus in the U.S. arrived in mid-January. So, since the travel bans were put in place after COVID-19 was already spreading in the U.S., they weren’t effective, said Josh Michaud, associate director for global health policy at the KFF. (KHN is an editorially independent program of KFF.) A May study supports that assessment. The researchers found the risk of transmission from domestic air travel exceeded that of international travel in mid-March. Many individuals also still traveled into the U.S. after the bans, according to separate investigations by The New York Times and the Associated Press. Based on all this, experts said there isn’t evidence to support the idea that the travel restrictions were the principal intervention to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. On the other hand, the public health experts we talked to said multiple global and U.S.-focused studies show that lockdowns and implementing social distancing measures helped to contain the spread of the coronavirus and thus can be said to have prevented deaths. However, Trump can’t take full credit for these so-called lockdown measures, which ranged from closing down all but essential businesses to implementing citywide curfews and statewide stay-at-home orders. On March 16, after being presented with the possibility of the national death tally rising to 2.2. million, the White House issued federal recommendations to limit activities that could transmit the COVID-19 virus. But these were just guidelines and were recommended to be in effect only through April 30. Most credit for putting in place robust social distancing measures belongs to state and local government and public health officials, many of whom enacted stronger policies than those recommended by the White House, our experts said. ""I don’t think you can directly credit the federal government or the Trump administration with the shutdown orders,"" said Lessler. ""The way our system works is that the power for public health policy lies with the state. And each state was making its own individual decision."" Some studies also explore the potential human costs of missed opportunities. If lockdowns had been implemented one or two weeks earlier than mid-March, for instance, which is when most of the U.S. started shutting down, researchers estimated that tens of thousands of American lives could have been saved. A model also shows that if almost everyone wore a mask in the U.S., tens of thousands of deaths from COVID-19 could have been prevented. Despite these scientific findings, Trump started encouraging states — even those with high transmission rates — to open back up in May, after the White House’s recommendations to slow the spread of COVID-19 expired. He has also questioned the efficacy of masks, said he wouldn’t issue a national mask mandate and instead left mask mandate decisions up to states and local jurisdictions. President Trump is claiming that if not for his efforts, there would have been 2 million more deaths in the U.S. from COVID-19. But that 2 million number is taken from a model that shows what would happen without any mitigation measures — that is, if citizens had continued their daily lives as usual, and governments did nothing. Experts said that wouldn’t have happened in real life. And while lockdowns and social distancing have indeed been proven to prevent COVID-19 illness and deaths, credit for that doesn’t go solely to Trump. The White House issued federal recommendations asking Americans to stay home, but much stronger social distancing measures were enforced by states. Travel restrictions implemented by Trump perhaps helped hold down transmission in the context of broader efforts, but on their own, they don’t seem to have significantly reduced the transmission rate of the coronavirus. We rate this claim Mostly False.",Conflicting,Conflicting

While there is some evidence to suggest a cooling trend over the 4,000 years prior to the Industrial Revolution, there is also data to suggest a warming trend over that same time period. The chart displayed in the video only shows ice surface temperatures at one location and does not reflect global temperatures.The claim is off base about both of the more recent time periods.Global land and ocean surface temperatures increased roughly 1.4 degrees in the 38 years between 1984 and 2022, according to NOAA data. The same data shows global warming of roughly 1.9 degrees in the 150 years between 1872 and 2022.Multiple independent climate agencies have reported similar trends.Fact check: Contemporary, human-driven warming has different ramifications than past warmingIn the video, Plimer unequivocally asserts that global temperatures have cooled over the last 4,000 years. But there is not a clear scientific consensus on this point.""Whether global average surface temperature warmed or cooled during the millennia prior to industrialization is still a matter of debate,"" Darrell Kaufman, a paleoclimatologist at Northern Arizona University, told USA TODAY in an email.Modeling studies tend to show Earth was warming prior to industrialization, but analyses based on other types of physical data tend to suggest it was cooling, Kaufman said.Ellie Broadman, a paleoclimatologist at the University of Arizona, who, with Kaufman, recently published a review of paleoclimate temperature trend research, says its most likely that a mild cooling trend driven by ""slight variations in the Earth’s orbit around the sun"" began about 6,500 years ago.""It’s important to note, however, that this cooling trend sharply reversed starting during the Industrial Revolution – around 1850 – when humans dramatically increased our greenhouse gas emissions by burning fossil fuels,"" she told USA TODAY in an email.Fact check: Graph shows dated data from one area in Greenland, not global temperature changeYair Rosenthal, a Rutgers paleoclimatologist, recently co-authored a paper supporting the warming hypothesis. It argues the appearance of cooling in the climate record is related to seasonal temperature trends rather than annual trends. The paper describes a warming trend that began 12,000 years ago and was driven by receding ice sheets followed by increasing greenhouse gases, which may or may not have been related to pre-industrial human behavior.However, even accounting for that warming, the paper reports a sharp and rapid increase in warming beginning with the Industrial Revolution.""The (contemporary) rate of warming exceeds anything we have known from the past thousands of years,"" Rosenthal told USA TODAY in an email.While the chart in the video appears to be offered as evidence supporting Plimer's claims about global temperature trends, it does not actually show global temperatures.Instead, it shows ice surface temperature data derived from one ice core collected in Greenland in the 1990s, USA TODAY previously reported when fact-checking a different version of the graph.

41,"[Claim]:‘Parliament is getting KSh38 billion, the judiciary is getting KSh18 billion, basically 50% [of parliament’s allocation].’[Evidences]:Mudavadi was mostly correct that Kenya spends more on repaying debt than on its development expenditure. This has been the trend for the past six years, since the start of the Kenyatta administration.While Mudavadi was also correct that the budget for the judiciary is about half that allocated to parliament, he fudged some crucial facts in his explanations of why this shouldn’t be so.It is incorrect and misleading to say courts sit for six days a week compared to parliament’s three, and Mudavadi was also incorrect about the number of staff employed by both institutions.The state of Kenya’s economy continues toanimate public discussions, as thecash-strapped governmenttries to make ends meet.On 11 June 2020treasury cabinet secretaryUkur Yatani gave a much-watchedbudget statementin the national assembly.In reaction, opposition politicianMusalia Mudavadi, himself aformer finance minister,poked holes inthe spending planfor the new financial year which started on 1 July.Inan interviewon national TV on 11 June, Mudavadi specifically criticised the allocation for debt repayments, and also focused on funding for parliament and thejudiciary.The former vice president and deputy prime minister has recentlybeen criticalof the government's handling of the economy. On TV he made six key claims which we took a closer look at.We asked Mudavadi for evidence for the claims, and will update this report with his response. In the interview, he frequently referred to Yatani’s budget statement.Claim ‘We are dealing with a situation where the amount set aside for repayment of the debt is much higher than all the money that Yatani is putting together for development expenditure.’ Verdict correctCurrent levels of the public debt are a national talking point. There isa proposalto set up an agency to oversee this. In his speech, Yatani said Kenya had to be “cautious about future debt accumulation” and would look to borrow cheaply.But the budget had not shown any urgency to correct a “critical landmine”, Mudavadi said. He gave the amount set aside for debt repayment as “KSh900 billion, almost KSh1 trillion”.“We are dealing with a situation where the amount set aside for repayment of the debt is much higher than all the money that Yatani is putting together for development expenditure,” hesaid. “This is a crisis!”How much for loan payments?How much has been budgeted for debt repayment? Areportfrom the national assembly’s budget committee said that debt service for the 2020/21 financial year was an estimated KSh904.7 billion.The cost of debt financing “actually consumes more financial resources than development expenditure for which the debt is obtained”, the committeesaid.What about for development projects?The budget committee approvedKSh637.6 billionas the development budget. The treasury hadproposedKSh584.3 billion, while minister Yatani said the amount was KSh633.1 billion in his budget speech. All these figures are less than that set aside for repaying debt.To evaluate how much money has been used over the years to repay debt and for development, the monthly statements issued by treasury are beneficial, James Muraguri told Africa Check. He is the chief executive of theInstitute of Public Finance-Kenya.“This is the best document to use because it provides the actual money that is released out of the consolidated fund,” Muraguri said.Theconsolidated fundis where all income raised and revenues collected by the national government is kept. The fund first provides for obligatory payments such as debt repayments, salaries for some state officers and pensions.Only after these are paidcan other departments access the money.We checked all the treasury’s annual statements since 2013, when president Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration started, to establish if debt repayments exceeding the development budget was a once off, or a trend.Debt service versus development expenditure Financial year Debt service (KSh bn) Development expenditure (KSh bn) 2013/14 227.6 224.4 2014/15 416.2 270.3 2015/16 421.8 333.2 2016/17 435.7 394.2 2017/18 517.2 276.4 2018/19 826.2 306.5 TOTAL 2,844.7 1,805The numbers show debt repayments have exceeded the development budget for the last six financial years. The budgeted figures for the 2019/20 financial year, which ended 30 June, alsoshowdebt service was expected to take up KSh696.6 billion, while the development budget wasKSh704.2 billion.However, by 29 May, a month before the end of the financial year,KSh639.2 billionhad been issued to pay debts, whileKSh295 billionhad been issued for development expenditure. We therefore rate Mudavadi’s claim as correct.What’s the crisis?Kenya’s economy is import dependent , James Muraguri, the chief executive of the Institute of Public Finance-Kenya told Africa Check. This means it imports the bulk of goods meant for its domestic market.More than half of Kenya’s public debt is owed to foreign creditors. Servicing this debt and paying for its imports must be in dollars. With this crucial foreign currency leaving the country, the country’s economy can be left exposed.“The pressure on the current account at the central bank will be felt due to demand for the [US] dollar and the shilling losing ground,” Muraguri said. (Note: For more on the functions of foreign exchange reserves, read here . )Claim ‘Parliament is getting KSh38 billion, the judiciary is getting KSh18 billion, basically 50% [of parliament’s allocation].’ Verdict mostly-correctIn the budget speech, the finance minister proposed funding of KSh37.3 billion to parliament and KSh18.1 billion to the judiciary for the 2020/21 financial year. The estimates approved by parliament show that it will get KSh37.7 billion while the judiciary will get KSh18.1 billionWe therefore rate Mudavadi’s statement as mostly correct.Claim ‘Remember the judiciary sits six days in a week …’ Verdict incorrectMudavadi claimed that when not following the revised timetable set in place during the Covid-19 pandemic, the courts sit six days in a week. His argument was that the judiciary was underfunded.We asked the judiciary if this was correct.“Courts do not usually sit on Saturday or Sunday unless they have express permission from the chief justice in writing, and that has to be under exceptional circumstances,”Catherine Wambui, acting director of communications at the judiciary, told Africa Check.She said this was rare, and cited the14-day deadlineimposed byKenya’s constitution within which presidential election petitions must be determined as an example of when this had happened.During presidential election petition hearings in 2013 and in 2017, the judiciary sat on Saturday and Sunday.But it is not the norm for Kenyan courts to sit six days a week. They sit from Monday to Friday and do not sit on public holidays.Judicial staff may also be called in to work on public holidays to “to perform certain essential duties”, according to the judiciary’shuman resources manual.Claim ‘... and parliament sits three days a week.’ Verdict misleadingat “2.30 pm on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday”.However, the rules allow each of the two houses, by resolution “to meet at any other time on a sitting day; or to meet on any other day, in order to transact business”.Caroline Gaita is the chief executive ofMzalendo Trust, a project that keeps tabs on parliamentary performance in Kenya. She said the perception that sitting days are the only working days for the Kenyan parliament was misleading.Equating the sitting days to their working days is doing a disservice to their role, she told Africa Check.“The work of a member of parliament cannot be limited to the three days when the house sits,” she told Africa Check. “That is for their legislative role. They have other roles such as oversight and representation which are done through committees and/or physical visits to the constituencies”.She added: “On Fridays, throughout the weekend, and on Mondays they are usually in the constituencies. Committee meetings are usually held on Tuesday and Thursday mornings.”We therefore rate Mudavadi’s claim as misleading.Claim ‘The Judiciary has “almost 7,000 employees”.’ Verdict incorrectThe lateststate of the judiciary reportwasreleasedin January 2020.It covers the 2018/19 financial year andshowsthe judiciary had 5,584 employees on 30 June 2019. These were 153 judges, 546 magistrates and 4,885 other employees including registrars, legal researchers, law clerks and court assistants.In the financial year 2019/20 the judiciarywas expectedto hire 300 new employees.At the highest, the number of employees in the judiciary could only be 5,884. Mudavadi was off the mark by more than 1,000 employees. We therefore rate his claim as incorrect.Claim ‘Compare that with parliament with about 1,000 employees.’ Verdict incorrectAfrica Check haspreviously fact-checkedthis claim and found out that Kenya’s bicameral parliament had 9,940 staff as of 19 March 2019.Theclerk of the senate, Jeremiah Nyegenye, who is also the secretary of theparliamentary service commission, the administrative arm of parliament,shared datawith Africa Checkshowing that in March 2019 there were:830 permanent and pensionable parliamentary staff, 282 contract staff, and 10 seconded staff6,740 constituency staff in the 290 constituencies and 47 county offices46 staff serving 12 nominated lawmakersIn the senate, 940 staff serving 47 elected senators, and 64 serving nominated senators1,022 police officers attached to lawmakers in both houses(Note: We have reached out to Nyegenye about the latest employee numbers in parliament.

42,"[Claim]:The United States conducted more than 800,000 COVID-19 tests a day.[Evidences]:Pence implied that the US is consistently conducting over 800,000 tests a day but data shows an average 733,000 tests per day in August. Vice President Mike Pence on the third day of the Republican National Convention, claimed that the United States is conducting more than 800,000 coronavirus tests a day. However, Mr. Pence's figures do not match the available data. According to Johns Hopkins University, until June 2020, the United States was conducting 350,000 to 450,000 tests a day. According to the New York Times, when the coronavirus spread in the United States between late January and early March, large-scale testing of people who might have been infected did not happen, because of technical flaws, regulatory hurdles, and lack of leadership at multiple levels. Moreover, the C.D.C. also tightly restricted who could get tested and was slow to conduct community-based surveillance. Subsequently, the U.S saw a steady increase in testing, and the United States averaged about 172,000 tests per day in April, before ramping up to an average of 510,000 in June and nearly 750,000 in July. On some days, the data shows that the U.S did conduct over 800,000 tests in one day. But, the New York Times reported on August 15 that the reported daily tests trended downward for much of the first half of August, nearly stalling the nation’s testing response. Some 733,000 people have been tested each day in August, on average, down from nearly 750,000 in July, according to the COVID Tracking Project. NYT reported that this downturn in testing might be because of people’s frustration at the prospect of long lines and delays in getting results. They also noted that one of the key problems in the U.S is that they are yet to build a robust system to test vast portions of the population, not just those seeking tests. In his speech, Pence implied that the U.S is consistently conducting over 800,000 tests a day, however, according to data, that is not true, and we conclude that this claim is false. The COVID-19 pandemic has given rise to a lot of potentially dangerous misinformation.

44,"[Claim]:""The Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks, and some of them foreign banks, so that they could stabilize their operations.""[Evidences]:U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich wants to put people back to work, but since the private sector has not had much success, he wants to prime the economic pump by spending public money on roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects.There’s plenty of demand out there, Kucinich told Fox News’ Neil Cavuto on Sept. 7, pointing to an American Society of Civil Engineers report identifying an immense need for infrastructure repairs and rebuilding.But where would the money come from? States and local governments don’t have those kinds of dollars, Kucinich rightly pointed out. But, the Ohio Democrat added, the federal government does.""We just found out the other day that the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks, and some of them foreign banks, so that they could stabilize their operations,"" he told Cavuto.That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. After all, how can anybody simply create $1.2 trillion out of nothing?Well, it turns out Kucinich was pretty much on the money, no pun intended.Let’s take the first part of his sentence, that the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing.The ""Fed"" in this case is the Federal Reserve, our country’s central bank. It’s the job of the Fed to use monetary policy to keep inflation in check and to stimulate the economy to create jobs. It does this by buying and selling government-backed securities that either increase or decrease the amount of money in circulation.The Federal Reserve also serves as the lender of last resort to its member banks who are having liquidity problems and can’t go to other banks for short-term loans.With that in mind, let’s go back to 2008 and 2009 when the United States banking system was on the brink of disaster. Then-President George W. Bush created the Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, to buy up banks’ bad investments and later to infuse the institutions with badly needed capital. In Cleveland, PNC National Bank used TARP money to buy troubled National City.TARP, however, is not what Kucinich was talking about. TARP was orchestrated by the U.S. Treasury and used money borrowed from the sale of U.S. securities such as Treasury bills.Nor was he talking about the $800 billion stimulus package of 2009, much of which was in the form of tax cuts.Kucinich was talking about $1.2 trillion that the Federal Reserve had on loan, primarily to banks, at the peak of its emergency lending during the financial crisis. The figure comes from a Bloomberg News investigative story this past summer that analyzed detailed loan information released by the Federal Reserve.Indeed, many banks did get money. Morgan Stanley at $107.3 billion received the most, followed by Citigroup at $99.5 billion and Bank of America at $91.4 billion.The loans, however, were not handed out the way your bank down the street dispenses money, explained Walker Todd, former assistant general counsel to the Federal Reserve banks in Cleveland and New York City.Regular banks are limited in how much they can loan based on their access to money, be it deposits or other forms of financing. ""But the Fed, uniquely among institutions in our society, gets to create money out of thin air,"" Todd said.It does so by simply increasing the balance in a member bank’s account. No actual money is printed. It just shows up in the electronic ledger, new money that never existed before that’s now in circulation, boosting the aggregate money supply.Each bank, however, did have to put up assets as collateral in case the money wasn’t repaid. Some of those assets, according to Bloomberg, were junk bonds.Eventually, all the money was repaid, with interest. But according to Todd, rather than wipe the money off its books, the Federal Reserve chose to use much of it to further stimulate the economy by purchasing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage-backed securities on the open market. So that money remained in circulation.Finally, what about Kucinich’s claim that some of the $1.2 trillion went to foreign banks? Again, Kucinich was correct. Two of the several foreign banks getting help were Royal Bank of Scotland Plc at $84.5 billion and UBS AG of Switzerland at $77.2 billion. The Federal Reserve treats foreign banks operating in the United States the same as U.S. banks because they are all part of the same financial system.On a side note, even some companies, including General Electric, received emergency cash.So while Kucinich’s comment that ""the Fed created $1.2 trillion out of nothing, gave it to banks and some of them foreign banks so that they could stabilize their operations"" is a bit flip, maybe even pejorative, he was essentially correct in describing the unique money-creating capabilities of the Federal Reserve and how it was used.On the Truth-O-Meter, his statement rates True.",True,True
45,"[Claim]:Pope Francis announced during a sermon that God had instructed him to revise the Ten Commandments.[Evidences]:On 6 July 2015, the entertainment web siteReal News Right Now published an article reporting that Pope Francis announced during a sermon that he had been instructed by God to change the Ten Commandments: During his sermon, Pope Francis announced to Christians around the world that God had called upon him, instructing him “to revise the most sacred of texts, the Ten Commandments.” Given to the Israelites by God himself at Mount Sinai, the Commandments include instructions for worship and list several prohibited practices. Pope Francis said Christians around the world are “faced with ever-increasing temptations brought on by the evils of modern society.” The Pope said the updated Commandments reflect the changing times and include some minor rewording of the existing rules as well as the addition of two new Commandments. The Fourth Commandment, which advocates that proper respect be shown towards one’s parents, has been reworded in order to include children raised by same-sex parents. Pope Francis said the Seventh Commandment, prohibiting adultery and, among other things, homosexuality, has been removed entirely, as instructed by God, in order to extend “God’s grace to all His children.” Although Real News Right Now does not includes a disclaimer identifying its content as fake news, the above-quoted story is just that: another piece of fake news. Real News Right Now has published a number of other fabricated news items, including an article about President Obama’s stripping Texas of statehood and an article about his banning the possession of Confederate flags. The biggest indicator that Real News Right Now is a fake news publication comes from the site’s “About” page, where author R.

That data showed that 5,418,000 people were unemployed then , according to the narrow definition. These people are unemployed but tried to find a job in the last four weeks. The latest data, from January to March 2016, shows that the number has risen to 5,714,000 . The expanded definition of unemployment includes discouraged job-seekers.

The informal employment sector, as measured by Statistics South Africa (Stats SA), includes people informally employed, as well as people working in the formal sector or private households, but without a written contract or benefits such as medical aid or pension fund contributions. The DA's claim is correct for the second quarter of 2015, Stats SA's quarterly labour force survey shows. 2015 Informal employees in City of Cape Town % of total employment Unemployment rate Jan-Mar 135,000 9.5% 23.5% April-June 161,000 11.3% 22.6% July-Sept 171,000 11.6% 21.9% Oct-Dec 175,000 11.6% 20.5% Source: Stats SA quarterly labour force survey (Jan-March 2016) But the size of Cape Town's informal sector employment as a proportion of total employment is low relative to other metropolitan municipalities in South Africa, professor Dieter von Fintel of the Stellenbosch University's economic department, told Africa Check. Von Fintel said that only Tshwane's proportion was lower than Cape Town's. In turn, South Africa has a comparatively low informal sector share when compared to many developing countries. Claim ""Midvaal [has] the lowest unemployment rate in Gauteng."" Verdict correct The DA said their claim is based on 2011 census data, which showed that the Midvaal local municipality's unemployment rate was then at 18.8% .

It stated that ""since 2011, the City of Cape Town has created more than 140,000 temporary work opportunities for unemployed residents through this programme"". This is backed up by the City of Cape Town's annual reports, in which they reported creating 140,324 work opportunities between 2011/12 and 2014/15. ( Note: As Africa Check has previously explained , the number of opportunities does not correspond to the number of people who have benefited from the programme.

Verdict incorrect The DA's research unit told Africa Check that ""upon closer inspection we found that the heading for the unemployment figures that appear in the bar graph on page 13 of the manifesto is incorrect"". The unemployment data they cited was actually for October to December in 2015. That year the City of Cape Town's narrow unemployment rate was 20.5% as claimed. However, the metropolitan municipality with the lowest unemployment rate was eThekwini at 15.9% . Municipality Official unemployment rate Expanded unemployment rate City of Cape Town 20.5% 21.8% Buffalo City 23.8% 27.3% Nelson Mandela Bay 30.6% 30.6% Mangaung 22.8% 29.2% eThekwini 15.9% 24.3% City of Joburg 27.9% 29.2% City of Tshwane 23.4% 27.4% Ekurhuleni 30.8% 33% Source: Quarterly Labour Force Survey Quarter 4: 2015 Comparable unemployment data at metropolitan municipality level has only been released in Quarterly Labour Force Surveys since the beginning 2015. Prior to that, it was only available every ten years in the census.The DA referred to the incorrect information as a ""formatting error"" and said it was ""deeply regretted"". The latest data, from January to March of 2016 , shows that the City of Cape Town's unemployment rate had increased to 21.1%. The metropolitan municipality with the lowest unemployment rate was again eThekwini at 18.8%. Pro-poor spending Data provided by the City of Cape Town shows that the figure of 67% refers to what they call the ""service delivery budget"" Claim ""In the 2014/15 financial year, the City of Cape Town spent 67% of its budget in poor communities."" Verdict incorrect The ""service delivery budget"" includes the line departments City Health, Human Settlements, Safety and Security and Social and Early Childhood Development. It also includes parts of the budgets of other departments, such as Community Services, Transport and Utility Services. A number of departments are not included in the city's calculations. These include Compliance and Auxiliary Services, Corporate Services, Energy, Environment and Spatial Planning, Finance, Rates and Other and Tourism Events and Economic Development. If the city's figure of investment in poor areas and informal settlements (R17,504,774,569) is calculated as a percentage of the total latest publicly available 2014/15 budget (R35,458,835,000), the portion the city says it invested drops to 49.4%. Read our report for a detailed explanation. Governance Claim ""DA-run governments are recognised as among the best in South Africa by national government and a variety of other agencies."" Verdict correct The DA told Africa Check that they base this claim on three different evaluations: the auditor-general's reports from 2008/9 to 2013/4, as evaluated by the Dullah Omar Institute , a community law centre based at the University of Western Cape, with a research focus on multi-level government among others. the Government Performance Index , a metric compiled by the research and advocacy organisation Good Governance Africa , the Municipal Financial Stability Index (MFSI), compiled by the Ratings Afrika agency. Auditor-general's reports The Dullah Omar Institute publishes an annual Municipal Audit Consistency Barometer in which they categorise a municipality according to the audit outcome it most often achieved over the past 5 years, in this case over the period 2008/9 to 2013/4. There are five possible audit outcomes, listed here from best to worst: Unqualified with no findings (clean), Unqualified with findings, Qualified with findings, Adverse with findings, and Disclaimer with findings. According to the DA, it governs in 26 municipalities across four provinces: Gauteng and the Northern, Eastern and Western Cape. The Dullah Omar Institute's report shows the DA mostly scored clean (unqualified with no findings) and unqualified opinions with findings between 2008/9 and 2013/4: Clean: 6 municipalities (City of Cape Town, George, Langeberg, Mossel Bay, Swartland and West Coast district) Unqualified with findings: 16 municipalities (Bergrivier, Bitou, Breede Valley, Cape Winelands district, Drakenstein, Eden district, Hessequa, Knysna, Laingsburg, Midvaal, Overberg district, Overstrand, Saldanha Bay, Stellenbosch, Theewaterskloof and Witzenberg) Qualified with findings: 1 municipality (Hantam) Disclaimer: 1 municipality (Baviaans) Not submitted: 2 municipalities (Swellendam and Karoo Hoogland). The auditor-general's report for 2014/15 on the outcome of municipal audits , released yesterday, showed that 21 DA-run municipalities achieved a clean audit, 3 an unqualified with findings opinion and 2 a qualified with findings opinion. But the auditor-general's reports speak to financial governance and not necessarily all aspects of service delivery, Karen Heese, an economist at research organisation Municipal IQ told Africa Check. Independent consultant to national and local governments Dr Andrew Siddle explained to Africa Check that the auditor-general's reports show ""three things only: the soundness of financial reporting, [a municipality's] legislative compliance, and the soundness of its reporting on performance management"". When a municipality gets a ""clean"" report, it means that it has passed the test for all three of these elements - ""nothing more, nothing less"". Nonetheless, ""if a municipality passes the 'clean' test, then it may logically claim to be doing some things right, and that can be justifiably be interpreted as a reflection on its approach to governance"", Siddle added. As such, auditor-general reports ""should be and are taken seriously"". Government Performance Index As for the Government Performance Index , the DA told Africa Check that it shows that ""12 out of the 20 best run municipalities in the country are governed by the DA, with 9 of them in the top 10. Good Governance Africa ranked the country's 234 local and metropolitan municipalities according to 15 different criteria across three spheres of performance: administration, economic development and service delivery."" Africa Check verified the DA's standing in the index. However, Heese cautioned against relying too much on the Government Performance Index as its measure of a municipality's performance is based on limited information. Ratings Africa Africa Check was unable to verify the DA's claims about the Municipal Financial Stability Index produced by Ratings Afrika . Analyst Charl Kocks said the data broken down by municipality was ""proprietary"" and we need to buy the report at a cost of R100,000 to access that. However, Kocks did confirm that the average score for the Western Cape was 60 out of 100 and that it was the highest scoring province in the country, as the DA claimed. However, he could not tell us how many of the 22 DA-run municipalities in the Western Cape were included in the index. Kocks explained that their ratings were based on municipalities complying with their requests for various categories of information. Whether or not all of the 30 municipalities in the Western Cape complied is unknown. Claim ""The City of Cape Town has repealed over 300 [apartheid-era policies, structure plans, bylaws and other procedures]."" Verdict correct The DA manifesto promises that the party will create ""a regulatory business environment that promotes growth and innovation"". One of the ways it says it will do so is by repealing ""apartheid-era policies, structure plans, bylaws and other procedures which contradict our commitment to freedom and fairness and which pose barriers to economic development and job-creating growth"". In the City of Cape Town, the DA claimed it had already repealed ""over 300 such policies"". The first document the DA sent us contained only 261 such policies. The list included policies from post-1994 - such as the ""Goodwood Policy on the erection of Wendy houses"" (1997) and ""Fencing guidelines for N1 City, Goodwood"" (2001). In response, the DA said: ""We do not believe the text suggests that the structure plans, bylaws and other procedures are all apartheid-era; indeed, a cursory look at the list should show that the policies, structure plans, bylaws and other procedures from the democratic era have also been repealed."" The party then forwarded us a document listing an additional 75 policies, structure plans and frameworks as proof. Health Claim ""The City of Cape Town runs six facilities dedicated to providing treatment for alcohol and drug addiction."" Verdict correct The DA claims in its manifesto that the City of Cape Town runs treatment centres ""in accordance with the Matrix Model of treatment"" in Delft South, Khayelitsha, Manenberg, Milnerton, Parkwood and Tafelsig. A leaflet provided to Africa Check explains that the Matrix Model is an intensive outpatient treatment programme developed in the US. Africa Check called the centres on the list and confirmed that they offer Matrix Model treatment. However, the international Matrix Institute on Addictions lists only two of the centres as officially accredited on its website . Housing Claim ""The DA is making great strides compared to other metros in the country - as of February 2015, Nelson Mandela Bay had 50,000 outstanding title deeds"" Verdict correct The DA pointed us to a February 2015 parliamentary reply by the ministry of human settlements as proof. It showed that the Nelson Mandela Bay metro had by far the most title deeds yet to issue, followed by the City of Cape Town. Metro Outstanding title deeds on 20 February 2015 Buffalo City 5,835 Nelson Mandela Bay 50,934 Mangaung 5,190 Ekurhuleni Did not submit information City of Johannesburg None outstanding City of Tshwane 8,237 eThekwini 3,628 City of Cape Town 11,059 The figure has since changed. Nelson Mandela Bay's municipal manager, Mthubanzi Mniki told Africa Check only 15,339 title deeds were outstanding as of 30 April 2016. Of these, 1,473 were for pre-1994 housing stock and 13,866 for post-1994 stock. The information is not yet publicly available, though. Water loss Claim ""...the Drakenstein municipality managed to reduce annual water losses from 34.8% to 12.1% in little over a decade. The campaign also showcases how DA local governments can reverse the decline of a municipality by identifying problems and taking proactive steps to address them."" Verdict incorrect The Drakenstein municipality is located in the Western Cape and comprises the towns of Paarl and Wellington. Van Damme told Africa Check that the figures cited were supplied by the municipality. She provided a booklet which stated that ""water losses in the Drakenstein municipality were an unacceptable 34% in 1999... Through a coordinated programme of action, the municipality reduced the water losses to 12.1% by 2013."" The municipality was however only formed in December 2000 when the Paarl and Wellington municipalities were amalgamated. Drakenstein municipality spokesman, Mart-Marié Haasbroek, told Africa Check that the figures shared by the DA were from the town of Paarl, located in the Drakenstein municipality. They could not be attributed to the municipality as a whole. ""Before 2012, the statistics for the other towns in Drakenstein were estimated and are therefore less reliable and reflects more erratically. Data for Paarl has always been accurately measured,"" said Haasbroek. Help us fact check! Claim: ""The DA-run City of Cape Town has rolled out more than 200 public Wi-Fi zones, used by tens of thousands of residents on a weekly basis."" DA spokesman Phumzile van Damme told Africa Check: ""The City of Cape Town currently has 201 public Wi-Fi access points at 78 sites."" She sent us a spreadsheet of the locations. We have uploaded a number of the locations to this Google map. You can help us fact-check this claim by connecting to the Wi-Fi network to see if it works.

48,"[Claim]:Was Martha Kanter ""dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million in stimulus money"" to save Craig Robinson’s job?[Evidences]:Every two years, just like clockwork, here it comes -- a chain email claiming that a federal assist worth millions of dollars saved Craig Robinson’s job as Oregon State University basketball coach. ""Thank Goodness For The Stimulus!!!"" trumpets the anonymous email, which first popped up in March 2010. ""But $17 million for one job? I wonder what mine is worth?"" An updated version is making the rounds again, urging people to vote this November. A PolitiFact Oregon reader received it from an acquaintance and passed it along to us. The claim: The email focuses on Robinson, who is first lady Michelle Obama’s brother and President Barack Obama’s brother-in-law. The piece alleges that Oregon State officials in 2010 were ""seriously considering"" firing Robinson after his team’s ""dismal"" start to the 2009-10 basketball season. ""When word reached Washington, D.C.,"" it continues, ""Undersecretary of Education Martha Kanter was dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million in stimulus money for the university. Craig Robinson’s job is safe for another year."" It notes the first family connections and closes: ""If this doesn’t anger you, nothing will … remember to vote this fall!!!!"" The analysis: The crux of the claim involves the charge that Bob DeCarolis, Oregon State’s athletic director, was preparing to fire Robinson after a ""dismal 8-11 start (2-5) in the Pac 10 Conference."" The university changed its mind, supposedly, only after Kanter, formerly the Obama administration’s highest-ranking higher education official, was ""dispatched"" to Corvallis with oodles of stimulus money. We called Steve Clark, OSU’s vice president for university relations and marketing. ""It’s interesting that it comes up again now,"" he said, ""just a few months before the elections."" As for stimulus money -- from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, passed by Congress and signed by Obama after the 2008 onset of the Great Recession -- Oregon State did receive some. ""As did public universities throughout the nation,"" Clark said. OSU’s share totaled $26.4 million. ""That funded 61 research projects and some infrastructure,"" he added, ""all associated with issues consistent with Oregon State’s research mission."" However, a problem of timing surfaces immediately. By Oct. 12, 2009, OSU had already received and spent $17.8 million in stimulus money, according to a story by education reporter Betsy Hammond of the Oregonian (the remainder was spent later, on a rolling basis). So that’s likely where the $17 million referred to in the chain email came from. But when OSU’s 2009-10 basketball season came along, that money was already gone. The Beavers didn’t get to two wins and five losses in league play -- the point at which DeCarolis, according to the email, was mulling firing Robinson -- until their Jan. 23, 2010, road loss to California. It should also be noted that the funds came through the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund, a program set up to help educational institutions retain top teachers and professors. Individual states, not the federal government, chose the recipients. We emailed Kanter, now a visiting professor at New York University Steinhardt. ""I have no idea where this rumor stems from,"" she wrote. ""I never traveled to Corvallis to award $17 million in stimulus money in 2010, nor do I personally know Craig Robinson."" She also provided a link to another fact-checking site that debunked the claim. OSU officials said they have no record of Kanter showing up in Corvallis around that time, nor is there any evidence of news stories detailing a trip. DeCarolis has flatly denied the story several times. It would also be highly unusual for any major college program to fire a coach so early in a season, especially considering that Robinson’s team the year before finished with an 18-18 win-loss record and earned OSU’s first post-season championship by winning the 2009 College Basketball Invitational. As for Robinson, the run didn’t last forever. DeCarolis fired him May 5, 2014, after six seasons and a win-loss record of 94-105. The ruling: A recycled chain email claims OSU basketball coach Craig Robinson -- Michelle Obama’s brother and the president’s brother-in-law -- avoided losing his job in March 2010 only because a high-ranking administration official was ""dispatched to Corvallis with $17 million in stimulus money for the university."" Records show that OSU had spent $17.8 million in stimulus funds months before the point when Robinson’s job was supposedly on the line. And there is no evidence that an administration official was ""dispatched"" to Corvallis. The state, not the feds, also chose how to spend the money. The claim has been debunked repeatedly, but keeps cropping up with nothing changed but the date. It’s not only false, but ridiculously so. We rate it Pants On Fire.",False,False
49,"[Claim]:Altered photo of Trump water bottles doesn’t show Ohio aid but a 2015 package sent to U.S. Senator Marco Rubio[Evidences]:A photo of yellow water bottles with a “Trump” label is being shared online following former U.S. President Donald Trump’s donation of water bottles during his visit to the site of a toxic train derailment in Ohio on Feb. 22. However, this photo has been digitally altered and the original shows a package Trump sent to Florida Senator Marco Rubio in 2015. A freight train carrying hazardous waste derailed in East Palestine, Ohio on Feb. 3, according to Reuters reports (here), (here), (here). Trump visited the site on Feb. 22 during an event at a fire station to speak about the derailment (here). A tweet said: “Trump is grifting the people of E. Palestine pushing his own ‘colorful’ water. These people haven’t been through enough apparently. He’s telling them to only drink Trump water!” alongside a photo of Trump Ice bottles of water that appear yellow in color (here).

50,"[Claim]:Old, miscaptioned videos surface amid unrelated events in Chicago in April 2023[Evidences]:(Advisory: Some of the links in this article contain violent imagery) Three videos have been miscaptioned online to say they show recent scenes of looting and unrest in Chicago. They were shared after Walmart announced it was closing some stores in the city and after separate reports of crowds blocking traffic and unrest in the city’s downtown on the weekend of April 15-16. Some posts sharing miscaptioned clips refer to the closure of four out of the eight Walmart stores in Chicago, a move the retailer attributed to them not being profitable (here). Others are referencing crowds of young people that were spotted in downtown Chicago over the weekend (here) where at least fifteen people were arrested and two people were shot in the Chicago Loop, PBS reported ((here). An April 17 tweet with a video showing people fighting near the entrance of a store has been retweeted over 1,400 times. “Just another Sunday night in a Chicago Walmart. There is no question why they are closing stores,” it reads (here). The footage, however, is not recent and was not recorded in Chicago. It can be traced to at least Oct. 12, 2022, when fragments of the same video appeared in media reports locating the brawl to a Walmart store in Ferguson, Missouri (here), (here). Another clip purports to show a Walmart store ransacked in Chicago this past weekend (here) (here). Reuters could not independently verify the source of the video, but it dates back to at least June 1, 2020 and appears to show the aftermath of looting and civil unrest following the protests over the killing of George Floyd. A tweet identifying the location to be a Walmart store in Chicago here (goo.gl/maps/Z9UyhoXYdimoBAfc9) is viewable (here). In June 26, 2020, PBS affiliate WTTW reported that a Walmart store at 4720 S. Cottage Grove Ave was among others in Chicago closed as a result of the unrest (here). A third miscaptioned clip shows a crowd at a gas station, where at least two people are jumping on the roof of a car. “Chicago punks out rioting, looting, and causing mayhem!” reads an April 16 tweet with the video (here). The earliest iteration Reuters identified dates to an April 12, 2023 tweet (here) which says it was filmed on April 2 “at Georgia State University RaceTrac gas station.” Reuters could not independently verify the footage, but images on Google Street View match a Racetrac gas station in Atlanta, Georgia (here!3m6!1e1!3m4!1spOEBdaz5qos_wZX5hXX25w!2e0!7i16384!8i8192). The clip may be related to large crowds that were seen near that gas station on April 2.

51,"[Claim]:In a June 2022 dissenting opinion, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas asserted a debunked claim about the use of aborted fetal cells in COVID-19 vaccines.[Evidences]:When the COVID-19 vaccines were being developed in 2020, one persistent rumor held that these vaccines contained the cells of aborted fetuses. This is false. As we wrote in December 2020, again in March 2021, and again in October 2021, none of the COVID-19 vaccines contains aborted fetal cells. However, many vaccines, including the most commonly used COVID-19 vaccines, were developed using what researchers describe as “historic fetal cell lines” in their research and testing phases. James Lawler, associate professor in the Department of Internal Medicine at the Nebraska Medical Center, defined “fetal cell lines” and explained how they’re different from aborted fetal cells as follows: The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain any aborted fetal cells. However, fetal cell lines – cells grown in a laboratory based on aborted fetal cells collected generations ago – were used in testing during research and development of the mRNA vaccines, and during production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine … Fetal cell lines are cells that grow in a laboratory. They descend from cells taken from abortions in the 1970s and 1980s. The practice of using fetal cell lines in the development of the COVID-19 vaccines resurfaced as an issue in June 2022, after U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas mentioned it in a dissenting opinion published after the court declined to take up a case related to New York’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Thomas wrote that COVID-19 vaccines were “developed using cell lines derived from aborted children.” This is true. When news outlets reported on Thomas’ dissent, many suggested Thomas had cited a debunked claim. NBC News, for example, wrote that the Supreme Court justice had cited the “debunked claim that Covid vaccines are made with cells from ‘aborted children.'” Politico and Axios published similar stories, with Axios’ story originally being published under the title “Clarence Thomas suggests COVID vaccines are made with ‘aborted children.'” On social media, this claim was even further exaggerated, with one Instagram post with more than 170,000 likes falsely stating that Thomas had written that the COVID-19 vaccines “contain the cells of aborted children.” But that isn’t what Thomas wrote. Thomas did not claim that COVID-19 vaccines contain aborted fetal cells. What Thomas did say is that the COVID-19 vaccines were “developed using cell lines derived from aborted children.” Despite his use of the highly politicized term “aborted children” (as opposed to “aborted fetuses”), his claim that such cell lines were used in the development of COVID-19 vaccines is accurate. Here’s the full quote from Thomas’ dissent: Petitioners are 16 healthcare workers who served New York communities throughout the COVID–19 pandemic. They object on religious grounds to all available COVID–19 vaccines because they were developed using cell lines derived from aborted children. Pet. for Cert. 8. Ordered to choose between their jobs and their faith, petitioners sued in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of New York, claiming that the State’s vaccine mandate violated the Free Exercise Clause. Again, for clarity, “fetal cell line” refers to cells that were grown in a lab. While it is true that these cell lines were derived from a fetus that was voluntarily aborted in the 1970s, none of the original fetal tissue remains in these cell lines.

52,"[Claim]:Her health care plan will cost $110-billion in the first year, which can be paid for with savings.[Evidences]:The health care plan proposed by Clinton doesn't offer lots of details, but in one spot the figure is in black and white: first-year cost, $110-billion. The proposal goes on to show how that cost would be paid for with savings from other changes to the health care system. There's no way to verify the $110-billion figure, but those off-setting savings? They're pretty optimistic, which is why we rate this claim as half-true. Much of the savings would come from ""discontinuing"" the 2001 tax cuts to households with incomes over $250,000 per year, which are scheduled to expire in 2010. Clinton, like most Democrats, has proposed letting those high-income tax cuts expire, which the Congressional Budget Office says would generate $52-billion in tax revenues. Over half of the $110-billion would come from such things as saving $10-billion by phasing out excessive Medicare payments to HMOs and other managed care plans. While it is true that the $10-billion in overpayments to Medicare HMOs exists in the system, so far the Senate has not agreed to such cuts. Whether Congress under a Clinton presidency would agree to slash reimbursements to a powerful private insurance lobby is yet to be seen. The plan also estimates that $35-billion could be saved by ""modernizing the health system"" by encouraging health care providers to adopt cost-saving information technology programs and better management of chronic diseases such as diabetes. Clinton's policy expert said the figure is a very conservative estimate and multiple studies suggest the actual figure will be much higher. The Clinton campaign cited a 2005 Rand Corp. study that put the potential savings at $77-billion per year. But that study is not without critics. Dr. David Himmelstein and Dr. Steffie Woolhandler, practicing physicians as well as professors at Harvard Medical School, criticized the Rand study, noting that it was funded by a technology company.At the time, the two physicians wrote inHealth Affairs, ""For decades, vendors have capitalized on this enthusiasm. But hospitals and clinics have ended up with little to show for their large outlays."" Himmelstein said Tuesday that promises of big savings through information technology is ""pure vaporware."" ""And though there's some evidence that disease management improves care, there's no evidence it saves money,"" he said. ""People getting in to see their doctors means more cost, not less.""

53,"[Claim]:Avoid ice cream and cold drinks for 90 days to avoid Coronavirus[Evidences]:A viral message urging people to avoid ice creams and cold drinks for the next 90 days to prevent the novel Coronavirus is misleading. The recent outbreak of the virus in China and the subsequent spread of it to other nations has led to the dissemination of misinformation surrounding the virus. The message states that the deadly virus that China is facing may come to India soon and that people should avoid consuming ice creams, milkshakes, cold drinks, and milk sweets for the next 90 days to protect themselves from the spread of the Coronavirus. BOOM received the same message multiple times on its helpline to check for the veracity of the text. Coronavirus has been misspelled as Koronavirus in the messages.

Fact Check BOOM has established in its previous stories that this virus originated from an unidentified animal source as explained by scientists researching the new virus. Also read: Coronavirus In China: All You Need To Know The 2019-nCoV, as the virus is called, originated in Wuhan's seafood market and has since then transmitted through air borne transmission. The current mode of transmission of the virus is known to be travelling to and fro the affected district and staying in close proximity of people showing signs of being infected by the disease. Common cold and cough, and fever moving to pneumonia are the well recognised symptoms of the virus which can only be identified as the novel Coronavirus if the genetic sequence of the virus resembles that of the novel Coronavirus. The virus does not spread through the consumption of substances such as ice creams, cold drinks, and sweets which are commonly considered to cause colds in individuals.

The text of the post says: ""That burglary and DWI will get you every time."" We’ve looked at O’Rourke’s arrest record in the past, but is he ineligible to purchase a gun, as the post suggests? Both DWI, burglary arrests were dismissed O’Rourke was arrested twice in the 1990s — for, what he describes as, jumping a fence on the campus at the University of Texas at El Paso and for driving while intoxicated. He was first arrested in May 1995 on the UTEP campus for attempted forcible entry, according toa copy of the police reportprovided by O’Rourke’s campaign in 2018. The charge fell under the burglary portion of the state penal code,section 30.02. O’Rourke told the El Paso Times in 2005 that UTEP ""decided not to press charges"" and a LexisNexis background check of O’Rourke shows that the Class B misdemeanor was dismissed. In September 1998, O’Rourke wasarrested and charged with driving while intoxicatedin Anthony, a small town outside El Paso. A witness told police officers that they observed O’Rourke driving at a high speed before losing control of his car and striking a truck, according toa police report of the incident. O’Rourke then attempted to drive away, but the witness stopped him, according to the report. Law enforcement arrived and arrested O’Rourke, recording that he scored a 0.136 and 0.134 on a breathalyzer test, above a blood-alcohol level of 0.10, the state legal limit at the time. O’Rourke was charged with a misdemeanor DWI, but the charge was dismissed after he completeda misdemeanor diversion programin 1999. In summary: O’Rourke was arrested for two separate misdemeanors in the 1990s, including one for a DWI. Both cases were dismissed. O’Rourke could purchase a gun There is no requirement for a person to have a permit or license to purchase rifles and shotguns or handguns in Texas, O’Rourke’s home state. As long as a purchaser is older than 18 and, in certain cases, passes a background check, the person can legally purchase a firearm without a permit. (A permit is required to carry a handgun in public.) Licensed-gun dealers are required by federal law to conduct a background check for an individual seeking to purchase a gun if that person does not have a license to carry. But private sellers do not have the same requirement. Federal and state lawsin Texas prevent a person from purchasing and possessing a gun if they have previously been convicted of a felony or convicted of certain misdemeanors related to domestic assault. Certain people with a history of mental illness are also barred from purchasing a gun. O’Rourke would be able to purchase a gun, since he was not convicted of burglary or of driving while intoxicated — both charges were dismissed. Even if he had been convicted, neither charge would prevent him from legally purchasing and possessing a firearm today, since they were both misdemeanor offenses unrelated to domestic violence and were resolved more than five years ago. O’Rourke could also obtain a gun license Misdemeanor DWI offenses play a more significant role when it comes to obtaining a license to carry in Texas. State law allows for people, not including those in the prohibited categories outlined above, to possess a handgun in their home or in their car without a license to carry. People can also carry rifles and shotguns in public without a permit. In order to purchase a gun without a background check and to carry a handgun in public, a person must obtain a license to carry from the state. Requirements for obtaining such a licenseare more stringent than those for simply purchasing a gun. Most important in O’Rourke’s case is a requirement that a person is not currently facing charges for ""a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense"" and a requirement that an individual ""has not, in the five years preceding the date of application, been convicted of a Class A or Class B misdemeanor or equivalent offense."" The law also states that a person is not eligible to receive a license to carry if the person has been ""convicted two times within the 10-year period preceding the date on which the person applies for a license of an offense of the grade of Class B misdemeanor or greater that involves the use of alcohol or a controlled substance as a statutory element of the offense."" O’Rourke was arrested on a burglary charge in 1995, a misdemeanor offense that was dismissed. He was arrested for DWI in 1998, a misdemeanor offense that also was dismissed after he completed a diversionprogram. Neither arrest, taken separately or together, would prevent him from obtaining a license to carry a gun under Texas law. ""He has no convictions on his record, so there is zero collateral consequence, vis-à-vis his ability to get a gun license,"" said Steve Toland, an Austin-based defense attorney who handles DWI cases. The Texas Department of Public Safety, which administers the licensing program, lists answers to frequently asked questions on its website, including one about how dismissed charges affect eligibility. ""If charges were dismissed without prosecution, then they are not disqualifying,"" the post reads. If O’Rourke’s misdemeanor DWI had not been dismissed and he had been convicted, he would still be eligible to apply for a gun license today, since more than five years have passed. Had O’Rourke applied for a license after his arrests, when the charges were still pending, he would not have been eligible for a gun license. But since he was not convicted of either charge, he would have been eligible for a license once his cases had been dismissed. Our Ruling A Facebook post circulating after the Democratic debate said that O’Rourke can’t buy a gun ""due to his criminal record."" O’Rourke was arrested for two misdemeanors in the 1990s — for burglary and DWI. Both cases were dismissed and he was not convicted of either charge. O'Rourke could have passed a gun-purchase background check and obtained a license to carry once the charges were dismissed. Even if he had been convicted of these charges, he still could purchase a gun today. We rate this claim False. FALSE: The statement is not accurate",False,False
55,"[Claim]:“60% of patients admitted to the hospital in the UK have been fully vaccinated”[Evidences]:In a July 19 press conference, the U.K.’s chief science adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, incorrectly said, ""around 60% of the people being admitted to hospitals with COVID have been double vaccinated."" Vallance corrected himself later that day, tweeting: ""About 60% of hospitalisations from covid are not from double vaccinated people,"" Vallance wrote. ""Rather 60% of hospitalisations from covid are currently from unvaccinated people."" But by then, clips of Vallance’s initial statement began circulating online. A viral Facebook post repeated the incorrect statistic and said, ""60% of patients admitted to the hospital in the UK have been fully vaccinated."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post didn’t acknowledge Vallance’s correction, leaving the misleading impression that it was accurate. But even the corrected statistic has raised eyebrows. It suggests that 40% of hospitalized patients are people who were at least partly vaccinated. On his July 19 show, Fox News host Tucker Carlson cited the corrected statement and went on to question why it appears that so many vaccinated people in the U.K. are being hospitalized. ""The fact that anybody is going to the hospital, particularly a big percentage of people who are going to the hospital who have already been vaccinated, is the opposite of what they've been telling us here in the United States,"" Carlson said. ""They've been telling us anyone who is fully vaccinated is fine; the only people getting dangerously sick or dying from COVID are those people who have refused to get the vaccine."" The explanation lies in both the high rates of vaccination in the U.K., and the rapid spread of the delta variant of the coronavirus, health officials say. ""Even with a highly effective vaccine, it is expected that a large proportion of cases would occur in vaccinated individuals, simply because a larger proportion of the population are vaccinated than unvaccinated,"" a spokesperson for the agency said in an email. A July 23 technical briefing from the government agency Public Health England found that 229,218 delta variant cases were recorded between Feb. 1 and July 19. Of these cases, 7,790, or 3.4%, of the total recorded infections resulted in hospitalization. Of these 7,790 hospitalizations, 4,853 or 62.3%, of people were unvaccinated, aligning with the 60% Vallance mentioned. The breakdown for the remaining nearly 40% went like this: 1,101 (14.1%) had received both doses 1,148 (14.7%) were at least 21 days past their first dose 608 (7.8%) were fewer than 21 days past their first dose 80 (1%) of the samples sequenced could not be matched to someone. What all that means is that roughly 0.48% of people who tested positive for COVID-19, and had been fully vaccinated in the U.K., had to be hospitalized. Vaccination still helps prevent a large number of hospitalizations. While no vaccines are 100% effective, Public Health England cited a study suggesting that with two doses, both the Pfizer and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines are over 90% effective in preventing infections that require hospitalization. So even though the delta variant has reduced the efficacy of the available vaccines, the U.K.’s National Health Service still recommends vaccination against COVID-19. The country’s vaccination program is estimated to have prevented at least 21.3 million infections, 57,500 deaths, and 52,600 hospitalizations so far. A Facebook post said ""60% of the people admitted to hospitals with covid have been double vaccinated."" The claim was based on a misstatement by a U.K. health official. The official issued a correction where he said he meant to say that 60% of hospitalized patients were unvaccinated. The post didn’t acknowledge the correction. We rate this claim False.",False,True
56,"[Claim]:Tiffany Dover, the nurse in Tennessee, United States, who fainted after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, is now dead.[Evidences]:A viral message on social media claims that Tiffany Dover, the nurse in Tennessee, United States, who fainted after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, is now dead. This has been claimed by several websites, and many Twitter and Facebook users. Some suspect a conspiracy behind the Covid-19 vaccine as they believe the nurse died after vaccination. One such Facebook claim says, “The nurse who fainted after the Pf1zer \//\cc1ne died 10 hours later. Did you find this story in mainstream media....anywhere....? Of course we aren’t we being told the vaccines k1ll us...it’s part of the plan?” India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that Tiffany is alive. The hospital she works in released a video to show she’s doing well. Who is Tiffany Dover? Tiffany Dover is a critical care nurse at Catholic Health Initiatives Memorial Hospital in Chattanooga, Tennessee, US. On December 17, 2020, she fainted on live television after receiving a shot of the Covid vaccine developed by Pfizer. But this was not due to the vaccine. Tiffany later clarified on television channels that she has a medical condition wherein she is susceptible to fainting whenever she feels any pain. “I have a history of having an over-reactive vagal response, and so with that if I have pain from anything, hangnail or if I stub my toe, I can just pass out,” she said in an interview with news channel WRCB. The CHI Memorial Hospital had issued a statement saying that the hospital had administered the vaccine to six individuals, three physicians, and three nurses from the hospital on the same day (December 17). Dr Jesse L Tucker, a critical care physician at the same hospital, told WRCB, “The fainting episode is not an adverse reaction to the vaccine, but related to her medical condition.” As per the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website, “Fainting can be triggered by many types of medical procedures. In fact, CDC has received reports of people fainting after nearly all vaccines.” How is Tiffany doing? Several people had suspected that something was terribly wrong with Tiffany after the vaccination as they claimed she had not posted anything on Facebook or Instagram in the last five days. The CHI Memorial Hospital recently posted a video of Tiffany along with other hospital staff on Twitter saying that she is doing well. We’re pleased to share Tiffany Dover is doing well. Here’s a short video of her today surrounded by her colleagues who all support her. pic.twitter.com/yGyzKvwn89 — CHI Memorial (@CHI_Memorial) December 21, 2020 On December 19, the hospital had put up an update on Twitter saying, “Nurse Tiffany Dover appreciates the concern shown for her. She is home and doing well. She asks for privacy for her and her family.” Lisa McCluskey, vice-president of marketing communications at CHI Memorial Hospital confirmed to the Associated Press that Tiffany was doing well and working a shift at the hospital on Monday. Hence, the viral claim about Tiffany Dover’s death after receiving the Covid vaccine is baseless. INDIA TODAY FACT CHECK Claim Tiffany Dover, the nurse in Tennessee, United States, who fainted after receiving her first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine, is now dead.

57,"[Claim]:When Obama went to Pakistan in 1981, he could not have been traveling as a U.S. citizen.[Evidences]:In an effort to prove that Barack Obama is not eligible to be president, birthers have come up with some very creative arguments. A curious reader forwarded a chain e-mail that made an interesting claim.""Pakistan was on the U.S. State Department's 'no travel' list in 1981,"" read the e-mail. Therefore, ""when Obama went to Pakistan in 1981 he was traveling either with a British passport or an Indonesian passport.""The most effective chain e-mails, like the best lies, are built on an incorrect but seemingly plausible ""fact"" that they follow to what seems like a sound conclusion. In this case, the ""fact"" on which the entire argument rests is that Pakistan was on a ""no travel"" list in 1981. If that were true, Obama would either have had to use a different passport or enter the country illegally and request his passport not be stamped, as some Americans have done over the years to travel to Cuba.Obama has said he traveled to Pakistan in 1981. He was on summer vacation from college, and, after visiting his mother in Indonesia, he traveled to Pakistan with a college friend. However, according to the U.S. Department of State, the department in charge of issuing travel bans, Pakistan had a green light for adventurous U.S. citzens.""According to our Pakistan experts,"" said Ivna Giauque, a public affairs officer at the State Department, ""there was no travel ban to Pakistan in 1981."" Without the original premise that Pakistan had a travel ban, the rest of the argument deteriorates. The author of the e-mail may have been confusing a travel warning or travel advisory with a travel ban. The University of Illinois at Chicago Library has an archive of State Department documents, including one from Aug. 17, 1981, issuing a travel advisory for Pakistan. It is the oldest travel advisory document in the archive related to Pakistan. Even if Obama traveled after the advisory was issued instead of earlier in the summer, the State Department confirmed it wasn't illegal. Our good friends at Snopes and Factcheck.org found a travel article about visiting Pakistan published in the New York Times in June 1981, and it mentions nothing about such travel being illegal. An August 1981 letter to the editor in the New York Times by the U.S. Consul General in Lahore, Pakistan, encouraged people to come visit. We also found an ad in the New York Times from March which listed Karachi and Lahore as two destinations in their travel package.In 1981, travel to Pakistan was not illegal or prohibited.

58,"[Claim]:Video shows Hamas leader using children as human shields in 2021[Evidences]:“The children surrounded the leading cadre of Hamas, and smashed the Israeli drone beheading plan in one fell swoop!” reads the Chinese-language caption in this tweet. The video, shared on May 19, 2021, has been viewed more than 65,000 times. The clip shows more than a dozen children gathered next to a man shouting in Arabic, while a second man loads a shell into a weapon in the foreground. The same video was shared here and here on Twitter; and here on Weibo alongside a similar claim. The video circulated online as tensions between Israel and Islamist group Hamas escalated into deadly clashes before a truce took effect on May 21, 2021. The video, however, predates the recent Israel-Hamas conflict. A keyword search on Google found a longer version of the video published on YouTube here on February 13, 2014. Corresponding visuals can be seen from the YouTube video’s 22-second mark. Below is a screenshot comparison of the video in the misleading post (L) and the YouTube video from 2014 (R): The YouTube video is headlined: “**MUST SEE** Syrian Kids Launching Mortar Together!” The caption reads: “After the brutal SAF-Barrel Bomb Attacks these syrian kids decide to give a answer to assad.” The Arabic logo on the top left-hand side of the YouTube video reads: “Jaysh Al Mujahideen [The Mujahideen Army]”, which refers to a Syrian opposition group against the Syrian regime army and Islamic State group. The YouTube video starts with people shouting “Allahu Akbar”, or “God is greatest” in Arabic. The sound of shelling is also heard. The man crouching with the group of children can be heard saying: “To all those who left Syrians alone…Thank God for the new generation who believes in the Prophet Mohammed. This generation will lead us to victory and defeat Bashar al-Assad.” AFP could not confirm when exactly the video was filmed. AFP’s report on the Syrian war from February 8, 2014 states that more than 300 people were killed in battles across the country in a single day.

59,"[Claim]:Fifteen tennis players withdrew or retired from the Miami Open after suffering adverse effects of the COVID-19 vaccine.[Evidences]:A former Australian politician is among those to share claims that 15 tennis players withdrew from the Miami Open due to COVID-19 vaccine injuries. However, there is no connection between the players withdrawing and adverse effects of the vaccine. Official results ( women’s singles and men’s singles ), provided by the ATP and WTA event, cite various sports injuries or other illness as the reason for most of the withdrawals, which are backed up by players’ social media accounts. The claim was shared by Fraser Anning , a former senator for Queensland from 2017 to 2019, who is known for his controversial statements .  “A total of 15 tennis players have withdrawn from the Miami Open,” Anning writes on his post sharing a website link. “Naturally they’re doing all they can to blame it on other factors,” adding the hashtag #vaccineinjuries. The article Anning quotes is from The Richardson Post website , and claims that the tennis players withdrew because of “the vaccine. That’s what’s going on.” Other websites and social media accounts make similar claims linking vaccination, with some falsely reporting all the players had chest pains . A total of 15 players are listed on the official Miami Open women’s singles results ( here )  as withdrawing before play or retirement , which is leaving during a match. Camila Giorgi suffered a right wrist injury, as stated in media reports, while Garbiñe Muguruza discussed her shoulder injury on Twitter, as did Simona Halep and Caroline Garcia with their own injuries. Maryna Zanevksa posted on Instagram about problems with an “old injury”, while Karolina Muchova had abdominal injury problems which she confirmed on social media. Dalma Galfi also referred to injury pains on Instagram. Sofia Kenin pulled out due to an ankle injury according to media reports, as did Anna Kalinskaya with an arm injury, Angelina Kalinina with a thigh injury and Clara Tauson due to heat illness. Tauson’s father told Danish media that many players at the tournament had illnesses, and “more than a handful of players were facing similar problems and several had to withdraw from the tournament” (translated from Danish). The main image used with the Facebook post features former world number one Victoria Azarenka appearing to clutch her heart. But Azarenka retired controversially in the middle of a match citing personal issues, later adding her personal life has been “extremely stressful.” She has withdrawn from seven tournaments in the past 14 months, BBC Sport reported. Of the other players who withdrew, Paula Badosa retired mid-match and said she had been “struggling with illness” , but gave no indication this was due to vaccination. Marketa Vondrousova is listed on the Miami Open sheet as suffering from a “viral illness” , while Kateřina Siniaková confirmed on social media she was ill, due to abdominal injury, according to the Miami Open sheet. The Richardson Post also cites Jannik Sinner being forced to withdraw from the men’s tournament without mentioning that he left due to foot blisters . In total, there were four in the men’s draw who either withdrew or retired – Sinner, Reilly Opelka (right shoulder) , Matteo Berrettini (right hand) and Jan-Lennard Struff (right foot) . Tennis fans on message boards noted the high amount of withdrawals and retirements in Miami, however, injuries in tennis tournaments aren’t unusual, industry experts say , and there has been no link to COVID vaccines in news reports. Tennis players “are susceptible to a range of injuries including chronic overuse conditions and acute traumatic injuries,” according to a 2018 review of incidents . A British Journal of Sport Medicine study in 2016 noted “the high prevalence of unresolved or recurrent injuries” in professional players. The Verdict Fifteen women and four men at the Miami Open withdrew or retired from play, but there is no indication their exits had anything to do with COVID vaccines. Official tournament records cite injuries and illnesses, which are backed up by multiple news reports and social media accounts from the players themselves.

60,"[Claim]:Images show 5,000-year-old Hindu sculptures found underwater in Bali, Indonesia[Evidences]:A screenshot with a collage of images of some underwater sculptures is being shared on social media, claiming that these are 5,000-year-old idols of Hindu gods that have been found under the sea near Bali, Indonesia. The text embedded on the screenshot reads, “5000yr old Shri Vishnuji found in Bali sea, Indonesia. Now Mahabratha as per @NileshOak Ji is 5500BC approx. So which Rajya of Bharat was Indonesia & did it participate in Mahabharata? Sanatan was always present in South Asia till Akhand Bharat boundaries @SatyaSanatanInd.” Here’s the link to the above post. Check similar posts here and here. The post has gone viral on Facebook. FACT CHECK NewsMobile fact-checked the above claim and found it to be FALSE. Doing a Reverse Image Search of keyframes from the video directed us to a YouTube video uploaded on March 24, 2012, by Paul Turley that carried glimpses of the viral images. The video description reads, “Again the underwater ‘Temple Garden’ just off ‘Temple Wall’ dive site in Pemuteran. Part of the ‘Reef Gardeners’ a social/environmental project created in 2005.” We searched more about Paul Turley and found out that he is the owner of the “Sea Rovers Dive Centre” in Bali. Turley took to his blog and stated that some of his images were shared on social media with some imaginary stories claiming that the sculptures show an underwater Hindu Temple. Turley wrote in his blog, “Apparently someone took my photo, posted it on Twitter and claimed an archaeological discovery off the coast of Bali. This went global, thanks to the internet and thus an urban legend was born. The follow-up story helped to clear up the matter but some journalists still got it wrong. Mystery of underwater Hindu temple in Bali solved.” We further searched about underwater sculptures in Bali and found many articles published on Turley and these underwater sculptures. The headline of the article states, “The underwater temple’ turns out to be an artificial garden.” Turley has claimed that the original idea of creating this underwater garden was of the founder of “Reef Seen Divers’ Resort” in Bali, Chris Brown. Going through the resorts’ website, we found out that the underwater garden was created in 2005. The website further states, “An engineering feat, with over ten large stone statues resting on stone plinths and, a 4-metre high Balinese Candi bentar gateway. It is found at a depth of 28 metres and incorporates a cleaning station with schooling baitfish.” We found another YouTube video uploaded by Turley which stated that “The Temple Garden was built in 2005 as part of the Reef Gardeners project.” More searches led us to various blogs and Pinterest images that carried the same images as seen in the viral claim stating that the underwater temple garden in Bali was constructed recently. The claim that this temple was built 5,000 years ago is a hoax. Thus, it is evident from the above information that the viral images of underwater sculptures in Indonesia are not 5,000-year-old but are from an artificial garden which was built in 2005. l If you want to fact-check any story, WhatsApp it now on +91 11 7127 9799 FAKE NEWS BUSTER Name Email Phone Picture/video Picture/video url Description Δ Click here for Latest News updates and viral videos on our AI-powered smart news",False,Conflicting
61,"[Claim]:""Since 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced toxic and health-threatening air pollution by 60 percent while our economy has grown more than 200 percent.""[Evidences]:A recent environmental flare-up in Congress drew the ire of one Georgia representative and an opportunity to dust off the Truth-O-Meter.U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson recently used his website to voice his outrage about a bill called the TRAIN Act.The bill passed the House of Representatives in late September with strong support by Republicans who said the act is needed to examine Obama administration environmental policies they say have resulted in higher oil, gas and coal prices. The bill, as of late last week, was in the U.S. Senate’s Committee on Environment and Public Works.Johnson, a DeKalb County Democrat, said the bill would block ""two of the most important, life-saving Clean Air rules in decades -- the mercury and air toxics rule and cross-state air pollution rule.""The congressman then argued it’s false to claim strong environmental regulations hurt big business and used some numbers to back up his case.""Since 1970, the Clean Air Act has reduced toxic and health-threatening air pollution by 60 percent while our economy has grown more than 200 percent,"" Johnson said.So are Johnson’s numbers correct?The congressman’s office said the information we wanted to check came from the American Lung Association. A spokesman for the association referred us to an Environmental Protection Agency report last year that found emissions for six common pollutants had declined by 63 percent since 1970. The EPA report also found the nation’s gross domestic product has increased by 204 percent in that same time frame.Several experts we spoke with said the EPA’s numbers were on target and had no quarrels with the federal agency’s research.""I think [Johnson] is on point,"" said Lynn Goldman, dean of the George Washington University School of Health Services.On the economic growth part of the claim, two local economics experts we interviewed thought that number was on target, too. They both looked at GDP data that was adjusted for inflation. Christine Ries, who teaches economics at Georgia Tech, said gross domestic product is the measure most commonly used to measure economic growth.Georgia State University economics department chairwoman Sally Wallace also found no problem with the math in Johnson’s statement. She did suggest we look at per capita income to examine the second part of the congressman’s claim. The growth in that category was also above 200 percent, from $19,167 in 1970 to the 2010 per capita income of $40,584.Johnson’s statement seems to imply that the Clean Air Act did not hurt the economy or even helped it. Wallace wasn’t sure a direct correlation can be made.She researched GDP 10 years before the Clean Air Act passed and the 40 years since and concluded that the average annual growth was greater before 1970. ""It’s kind of difficult to say it’s directly related,"" Wallace told us.Two groups joined forces last year to research the economic impact of the Clean Air Act. The Small Business Majority, an advocacy group for the nation’s 28 million small businesses, and the Main Street Alliance, a national coalition of small business networks in 15 states, concluded in its 10-page report that about 1.3 million jobs were created between 1977 and 1991 as a result of environmental regulations from the Clean Air Act. Using some EPA data, they believe the Clean Air Act’s benefits far outweighed the costs. The report criticized congressional efforts to scale back the EPA’s authority under the Clean Air Act.For years, as a 2001 paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research noted, manufacturers have argued whether the act puts them at a competitive disadvantage globally. The report by the widely cited think tank looked at 15 years of data and concluded that the regulations ""retard industrial activity.""Johnson is correct in his statement about the Clean Air Act’s impact on pollution. The rest of his argument was aimed at countering claims that strong environmental policies hurt business. The numbers the congressman used seem to be on target, but there’s some room for debate about the Clean Air Act’s impact on the economy. We rate his statement Mostly True.",True,True
62,"[Claim]:Mario Baloteli said he would like to win 2 ballon do'r for 2 clubs like Ronaldo and unlike Messi[Evidences]:Lionel Messi has won the Ballon d'Or award six times, each time as a Barcelona player. (Photo from December 2, 2019: Reuters) Who is the greatest footballer of our times, Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo? While this debate rages on, an Instagram post citing a critical remark from Italian football star Mario Balotelli has gone viral on social media. On December 8, 2019, an Instagram user posted a claim that said Italian forward Mario Balotelli wants to win the Ballon d'Or (world footballer of the year award) with different clubs rather than win it several times only for one club. Balotelli, who currently plays for Serie A (top Italian football league) club Brescia, has never won the Ballon d'Or. The Instagram post shared a screenshot showing Balotelli's photo and a quote that said: ""Mario Balotelli after 2019 Ballon d'Or award, 'I would rather win 2 Ballon d'Ors with 2 different clubs like Cristiano Ronaldo than win 5 or 6 Golden Balls with one club. What's the point of spending a whole career in one club and saying I'm the best really it's shameful?"" The name ""Footballworlds"" is superimposed on the screenshot. Barcelona star Messi is often criticised for having played and won trophies for just one club. He has won the Ballon d'Or six times, each time as a Barcelona player. Juventus's Ronaldo, meanwhile, has won the prize five times, but for multiple clubs. So, according to the post, Balotelli's alleged remark is a dig at Messi. The Instagram post was liked by more than 7,000 people. A similar claim was posted on several other social media platforms. The archive post can be seen here. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the post to be untrue. We also found that many social media users have commented on the post as ""fake quote"". We ran a keyword search on whether Balotelli has ever made this remark. We looked up his official Twitter account and didn't find anything that substantiates the post's claim. His Twitter handle carries the warning: ""Don't believe anything you read about me unless it is coming from here."" We checked his official Instagram handle as well and didn't find any comment related to this claim. After a keyword search, we found a news report in which Balotelli spoke about Messi, Ronaldo and the Ballon d'Or. An article published on Daily Mail on May 27, 2017 said, ""Mario Balotelli jokingly reveals plan to beat Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo to the Ballon d'Or: 'I will have to kill those two to win it'."" The article clearly doesn't quote the Italy striker as comparing himself to Messi and Ronaldo. In fact, in another article published on May 3, 2019 on football news website soccerladuma.co.za, Balotelli compared Messi with Ronaldo, categorically saying that the Barcelona player is better than his rival. This remark is the opposite of what is claimed in the Instagram post. In the article, Balotelli was quoted as saying, ""In terms of quality, Messi is better than everyone. I'm convinced that if you ask a defender if they would rather play against Messi or Ronaldo, they would have no doubts.""

63,"[Claim]:Says President Joe Biden promoted ""mandatory vaccines for everybody"" in his March 11 address.[Evidences]:The White House will direct state, local and tribal governments to make all American adults eligible to register for COVID-19 vaccines by May 1, President Joe Biden announced March 11. In a primetime address delivered hours after he signed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill into law, Biden said his goal is to make small-group gatherings possible by July 4. He encouraged Americans to get vaccinated and follow public health guidelines to make that happen. But the president did not say he would mandate that everybody get the vaccine, despite what one conservative commentator said in a Facebook live video reacting to the address. ""Now he is promoting, what sounds like to me, as mandatory vaccines for everybody, and then we could maybe celebrate the Fourth of July in small groups,"" David J. Harris Jr., a supporter of former President Donald Trump, said before showing clips from Biden’s address. The video, which is accompanied by text directing people to support My Pillow CEO Mike Lindell, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Harris Jr. did not respond to a request for comment sent via his Facebook page. But his video distorts what Biden said about scaling up vaccine availability. Here’s what Biden said about making all Americans eligible to sign up for vaccines: ""Tonight, I'm announcing that I will direct all states, tribes and territories to make all adults, people 18 and over, eligible to be vaccinated no later than May 1. Let me say that again. All adult Americans will be eligible to get a vaccine no later than May 1. That's much earlier than expected. Let me be clear, that doesn’t mean everyone’s going to have that shot immediately, but it means you’ll be able to get in line beginning May 1. Every adult will be eligible to get their shot."" Biden promised a new website to help people find vaccines near them, and he said additional guidance would be coming on what vaccinated people can and can’t do. Then, he urged ""every American to do their part"" to ""beat this virus,"" saying: ""I need you to get vaccinated when it's your turn and when you can find an opportunity, and to help your family, your friends, your neighbors get vaccinated, as well. Because here's the point. If we do all this, if we do our part, if we do this together, by July the 4th, there's a good chance you, your families and friends will be able to get together in your backyard or in your neighborhood and have a cookout or a barbecue and celebrate Independence Day. That doesn’t mean large events with lots of people together, but it does mean small groups will be able to get together."" Biden said the shots are safe, noting that he and Vice President Kamala Harris got theirs in front of cameras. ""We need everyone to get vaccinated,"" he said. But the president never said he was mandating that everyone get a vaccine. The federal government’s ability to impose vaccination requirements is limited, although states have some authority to do so, PolitiFact previously reported. Biden, like Trump before him, has not announced plans to make the COVID-19 vaccines mandatory. ""No, I don’t think it should be mandatory,"" Biden said in December. ""I wouldn’t demand it to be mandatory, but I would do everything in my power."" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, who Biden implored Americans to ""listen to"" during his address, has also said he does not support mandating vaccines, although he told Newsweek he expects certain institutions like hospitals to require vaccinations. The White House and Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A Facebook post said Biden promoted ""mandatory vaccines for everybody"" in his March 11 address. That’s inaccurate. In his address, Biden said the White House would direct state, local and tribal governments to make all American adults eligible to sign up for a COVID-19 vaccine by May 1. He urged Americans to get the vaccines, but he did not make them mandatory. Biden previously said he would not institute a federal vaccine requirement. In any case, the federal government’s authority to do so is limited. We rate this Facebook post False.",False,False
64,"[Claim]:Does This Video Show Brazilian Officials Breaking Into An Empty Hospital That Claimed To Have 5,000 COVID-19 Patients?[Evidences]:A videoshared on Facebookpurportedly shows Brazilian lawmakers breaking into an empty hospital that claimed to have 5,000 COVID-19 patients.



Verdict: False

The footage actually shows a Brazilian lawmaker inspecting a field hospital that had failed to open on schedule.

Fact Check:

Since itsfirst caseof COVID-19 in late February, Brazil’s government has reported more than 2 million cases and some 77,000 deaths from the disease at press time, according toJohns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.

The video depicts Brazilian lawmakerFilippe Poubelentering the grounds of the São Gonçalo Campaign Hospital in Rio de Janeiro. Poubel and the people accompanying him go through the facility’s gate, appearing angry and yelling at individuals already inside.

“WOW!!! Breaking News,” the caption reads. “Members of Parliament of Brazil break into hospital that claimed to have 5,000 infected & 200 deaths from COVID-19 & CAUGHT THEM RED HANDED NOT ONE PERSON, they have FRAUDED THE WORLD!!”

But, contrary to the post’s claim, the video doesn’t show Brazilian lawmakers as they “break into” the São Gonçalo Campaign Hospital, expecting it to have patients but finding it empty. The field hospital had neither opened nor started accepting patients yet when the footage was taken, according toAFP Fact Check.

The video comes from aFacebook livestreamPoubel shared on May 27, expressing his displeasure at the unfinished field hospital. He alsopostedthe footage on YouTube later that day. In the video, Poubel can be heard addressing viewers, saying at the beginning that he has come to inspect the facility because it failed to open the day it was supposed to, according to theYouTube’s English closed-caption subtitles.

Poubel appeared to confirm that the video had been miscaptioned when heretweetedAFP’s Arabic-languagefact check articledebunking the claim.(RELATED: Does This Video Show People In India Throwing Religious Statues Into A River During The COVID-19 Pandemic?)

The São Gonçalo Campaign Hospital was built to serve COVID-19 patients and had been scheduled to open at the end of April, according to the government-run news organizationAgência Brasil. The news agencyreportedthat the field hospital opened on June 18 with 40 of 200 possible beds in operation.

The World Health Organization announced on July 17 that coronavirus cases had reached a plateau in Brazil, one day after the country reached over 2 million positive cases, according toBloomberg News.",False,True
65,"[Claim]:406 constituencies voted to leave, 242 voted to remain in the EU referendum.[Evidences]:We've been asked to check an image that presents the EU referendum result split by constituency and region, and how MPs supposedly voted in the referendum. It's had over 35,000 shares on Facebook. Some of the numbers are not quite right, but all the trends are broadly correct. Below we've looked at each claim in turn. ""EU Referendum Results 2016 By Votes 17.4 million Leave | 16.1 million Remain"" This is correct . ""By constituency 406 Leave | 242 Remain"" This is broadly in line with the best estimates available, based on the seats parties won at the 2015 general election, although the numbers are not quite perfect (there are 650 constituencies in the UK, but the numbers in this image only add up to 648). Estimating referendum results by parliamentary constituency isn't easy , because the results weren't counted by constituency seat. Some councils released a breakdown of votes by constituency as well (although they didn't have to ), and the BBC accessed some data via Freedom of Information requests. The best overall figures we have on this are estimates from Professor Chris Hanretty , a political scientist at Royal Holloway University, who combined official results and the BBC data with statistical methods in order to estimate the proportion of Leave and Remain voters in every seat in England, Scotland and Wales (Northern Ireland published results by constituency). We've written more about these calculations here . Professor Hanretty estimated that 64% of seats in Great Britain probably voted to leave, or around 403 constituencies. Including the known results for Northern Ireland, that amounts to 410 constituencies voting leave (63%) and 240 voting remain. ""By constituency By Party Lab: 148 Leave | 84 Remain Con: 247 Leave | 80 Remain"" Once again, the numbers in this claim are not quite perfect but the trend is broadly correct. Using Professor Hanretty's estimates, and looking at the results from the 2015 general election, 249 Conservative-voting constituencies probably voted to leave, while 81 probably voted to remain (not including the speaker's constituency Buckingham, which probably voted to remain, based on these estimates). 148 Labour-voting seats probably voted to leave, while 84 probably voted to remain, which is exactly what the image says. Professor Hanretty acknowledges that we can't be certain about these numbers though, as there is some margin for error in the calculation. But if you take out the constituencies where there's most uncertainty about the result, the general pattern is still the same. Of course, there has since been another general election, so these figures don't reflect the situation today. However, even based on the 2017 general election results, the pattern is broadly the same . ""By Region 9 Leave | 3 Remain"" The image is correct in saying that nine regions overall voted to leave and three voted to remain (Scotland, Northern Ireland and London). ""By MP 160 Leave | 486 Remain"" Again, these numbers don't add up to 650, with four MPs unaccounted for. It's based on MPs elected at the 2015 general election, rather than the current set of MPs we have now, who were elected in 2017. It also refers to those MPs stated positions before the referendum, rather than after the result. The figures quoted are similar to the results of a survey by the Press Association, which asked every MP how they would vote in the referendum just before it happened in 2016. 480 said they would vote to remain, 159 said they would vote to leave, and 11 MPs did not declare. Politics Home published a similar article just before the referendum, based on public statements by the MPs, which concluded that 485 intended to vote remain, 156 to leave, and 9 had not declared. Of course, we can't know for sure how each MP voted in the referendum, so surveying them or using public statements is the best we've got. Providing a more up to date figure is difficult.  The more recent 2017 general election means some MPs have changed, and others have changed their position since the referendum result. We also know that many MPs who voted remain have since supported measures to leave the EU. 498 MPs voted in February 2017 in favour of triggering Article 50, which formally began the UK's exit process from the EU. Additionally, 286 voted in favour of Theresa May's withdrawal agreement in March 2019. During two rounds of the ""indicative vote"" process in March and April, the two options that would have opened the door to parliament potentially revoking Article 50 were defeated, each gaining fewer than 200 votes .",True,True
66,"[Claim]:A Harvard study showed that vaccinated people are “twice as likely to get hospitalized as opposed to if they had a natural exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, then got exposed to a Delta variant”[Evidences]:CLAIM A Harvard study showed that vaccinated people are “twice as likely to get hospitalized as opposed to if they had a natural exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, then got exposed to a Delta variant” more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Jen DePice, TLC4Superteams, 19 Jul. 2021 DETAILS Misrepresents source: The video inaccurately reported the words of epidemiologist William Hanage, an associate professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, during an interview. In fact, Hanage said that “an unvaccinated person with Delta infection is roughly twice as likely to require hospital treatment than a person infected with the previously dominant variant”. Furthermore, he actually encouraged vaccination. DePice also wrongly characterized the interview, published in a news article by the university, as a “Harvard study”. KEY TAKE AWAY The Delta variant of the virus SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious and more likely to cause serious illness compared to the wild-type (precursor) virus. COVID-19 vaccines are effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization and death caused by Delta variant infection, and remain one of our best tools at curbing the spread of the variant, preventing the generation of new variants, and returning to normal life. FULL CLAIM: A Harvard study showed that vaccinated people are “twice as likely to get hospitalized as opposed to if they had a natural exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, then got exposed to a Delta variant”; “Delta Variant Targets Vaxxers” REVIEW On 19 July 2021, a video titled “Delta variant targets vaxxers” was published on the Facebook group TLC4Superteams, run by a chiropractic organization. In the video, chiropractor Jen DePice claimed that a Harvard study showed vaccinated people are “twice as likely to get hospitalized as opposed to if they had a natural exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus then got exposed to a Delta variant”. The video received more than 42,000 views on Facebook in less than a day, and drew more than 2,000 engagements from users. DePice’s source for this claim, provided in a link in the video’s caption, was an interview with William Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The interview was published in a news article by the university. By reading the interview itself, it’s clear that DePice’s claim is inaccurate. Firstly, an interview isn’t a scientific study. Secondly, what Hanage actually said was: “Evidence suggests, for example, that an unvaccinated person with Delta infection is roughly twice as likely to require hospital treatment than a person infected with the previously dominant variant.” (emphasis added) Thus Hanage’s statement means the opposite of DePice’s claim. He was possibly referring to a study conducted in Scotland that was published in mid-June 2021 in The Lancet[1]. It reported that “Risk of COVID-19 hospital admission was approximately doubled in those with the Delta [variant of concern] when compared to the Alpha [variant of concern]”. Therefore, Hanage was comparing unvaccinated people’s risk of hospitalization from the Delta variant with that from the Alpha variant. This in no way resembles DePice’s claim. Furthermore, Hanage encouraged vaccination: “As for my advice: The pandemic is not over. Get vaccinated if you are not already. Pay attention to local conditions. If you don’t want to become part of the spread of Delta when it is surging, remember you can still wear a mask indoors in public places, especially crowded ones, and if Delta is surging in your area you can still avoid contributing to its spread by physical distancing.” (emphasis added) Indeed, the evidence that we do have on the Delta variant strongly suggests that vaccinated people are less likely to get sick and die from a Delta variant infection. While the COVID-19 vaccines’ efficacy against the Delta variant is slightly lower compared to the wild-type (precursor) virus, they still remain highly effective against illness and hospitalization. This means that a vaccinated person’s risk of becoming sick or severely ill with Delta variant infection is lower than that of an unvaccinated person. The Delta variant is currently the predominant variant in the U.K. Another example can be seen in the U.S., which also saw the Delta variant become the predominant variant in the country. By analyzing data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Associated Press reported that 99% of deaths from COVID-19 in June 2021 were in unvaccinated people, suggesting that unvaccinated people are more likely to develop severe illness compared to vaccinated people. Experts also told Washington Post in July 2021 that the Delta variant is driving a surge in case numbers and hospitalization among the unvaccinated. Health Feedback previously covered a related claim regarding the deadliness of the Delta variant depending on vaccination status. Overall, DePice’s claim misrepresented an interview with an epidemiologist as a study and inaccurately reported his words. Her claim that the Delta variant is more deadly for vaccinated people is unsubstantiated by scientific evidence and contradicts what we do know of the vaccines’ efficacy against the Delta variant.

67,"[Claim]:Says U.S. left 33 Black Hawks to the Taliban, which has more than “85%” of all countries.[Evidences]:Republicans say the U.S. military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan was so haphazard that it left the Taliban with a weapon only used by 15% of the world’s countries. In a Facebook post on Sept. 1, North Carolina Congressman Richard Hudson posted an image that said the ""Taliban’s new arsenal"" included 33 Black Hawk helicopters, adding: ""Thanks to President Biden, the Taliban now has more Black Hawk helicopters than 85% of countries in the world."" Hudson didn’t respond to an email about his post. But he later updated it, saying that social media companies had ""censored this post"" and that ""fact-checkers have disputed the exact dollar amount of equipment left in Afghanistan."" Hudson acknowledged that some of his numbers might be off, but said he wanted to emphasize the poor execution of the withdrawal. The claim comparing the Taliban’s Black Hawk arsenal to the rest of the world appears to have originated with Congressman Jim Banks, a Republican from Indiana. Banks cited the same statistic in a press conference on Aug. 25. It’s unclear whether the U.S. military left as many as 33 usable Black Hawks behind in Afghanistan. But even if the Taliban has just one, which reports seem to indicate, the claim that the Taliban has more helicopters than ""85%"" has factual basis. The U.S. military did have 33 operational Black Hawks in Afghanistan as of June 30, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Defense. (They’re also known as UH-60 helicopters) However, as PolitiFact previously reported and as Banks’ office acknowledged, it's unclear how many of the Black Hawks are now in the hands of the Taliban. Media outlets such as the BBC, NPR and the Washington Post have hesitated to report a specific number of Black Hawks under Taliban control. Meanwhile, one blog run by independent military analysts reports the Taliban seized 18 Black Hawks but that only six are operable. It’s also unclear whether the Taliban has the ability to effectively operate Black Hawk helicopters for warfare. Bradley Bowman, a former Black Hawk pilot in the Army, told NPR that learning to pilot Black Hawks is ""not something that you can do in a week or a month."" But that obstacle isn’t insurmountable. A bigger problem for the Taliban may be maintaining the Black Hawks, said Jonathan Schroden, the director of the Countering Threats and Challenges Program at the Center for Naval Analyses. Schroden told NPR the Taliban might ""not be able to fix them."" John Pike, a longtime military expert who founded the nonprofit research group GlobalSecurity.org, said the Taliban may have trouble finding pilots, too. ""The Taliban made a practice of assassinating pilots and air crews in recent years and might have some difficulty in tricking them to return to the warm embrace of the Motherland,"" Pike told PolitiFact NC in an email. ""Pakistan does not fly the UH-60 and so they will be of little help to their puppet regime,"" he continued. ""With few pilots, few maintainers, and no spare parts, the handful of flyable UH-60s will be of little use to the Taliban over the coming months, before they become completely unflyable due to lack of maintenance and spares."" Hudson and Banks both said the Taliban now has more Black Hawk helicopters than 85% of the world’s countries. Banks defended the figure saying that 85% of the world’s countries don’t have a Black Hawk at all. He cited a page on Black Hawk-builder Lockheed Martin’s website, which says the company supplies the helicopters to 29 countries in the world. PolitiFact NC called and emailed a spokesperson for Lockheed Martin to see if the company’s website is up to date, but didn’t receive a response. So let’s move forward with the information available and do some math. If there are 195 countries in the world and 29 have Black Hawks, that means 166 of them don’t — which comes out to 85%. That means, if the Taliban has taken even one Black Hawk, they would have more Black Hawks than 85% of the world. And it appears they do. CNN reported the Taliban included a Black Hawk helicopter in a recent air display. Russian media also tweeted a video purporting to show footage of the Taliban flying a Black Hawk. ""The simple math checks out,"" said Mitchell Hailstone, communications director for the Republican Study Committee, which Banks chairs. ""If the Pentagon would tell us how many Black Hawk helicopters the Taliban has in its possession, we’d be able to calculate a more accurate percentage,"" Hailstone said. Hudson’s post said the U.S. military left 33 Black Hawks that are now part of the ""Taliban’s new arsenal,"" and that the group now has more of the helicopters than ""85%"" of all countries. Hudson’s claim about the ""Taliban’s new arsenal"" is based on a report published before the last troops left Afghanistan on Aug. 30. So that may be off. His claim about how the Taliban’s stock of Black Hawks compares to other countries appears to be accurate. Hudson’s post gets some of the numbers right, but leaves out key context.

Verdict: False

A Starbucks spokesperson confirmed the promotion is not real.

Fact Check:

Numerous companies have responded to protests following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody, with condemnations of racism and support for racial equality, according toCNN. In this case, a Facebook postclaimsStarbucks has shown support for the Black Lives Matter movement through a drink promotion.

Thealleged promotionshows the hands of two people, one white and one black, holding up what appear to be Frappuccinos. Above the image, text reads, “We’re all in this together, Black Lives Matter! Come to any of our stores shouting these words for a free Frappuccino of your choice. The louder you shout, the larger the size you’ll get!”

But the Starbucks promotion is fake. A spokesperson for the company confirmed it was not a valid offer to the Daily Caller News Foundation.(RELATED: Is Starbucks Offering Free Drinks To People Of Color?)

“This is not a valid Starbucks offer,” the spokesperson said in an email. “Our customers may confirm any Starbucks promotion, by checking the Starbucks app, reaching out to our customer care line, or asking a Starbucks barista.”

This is not the first time Starbucks has been the target of a fake promotion. In February, Twitter users widely shared adigital couponthat falsely claimed Starbucks would give free drink vouchers to people who posted pictures of themselves listening to Lady Gaga’s song “Stupid Love.”

Starbucks has made public statements following Floyd’s death. On Twitter, the company tweeted astatementpromising to “confront racism to create a more inclusive and just world.” The company also held a forum “for any Starbucks partners who felt compelled to join a conversation about the murders of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor and the many other racial injustices that have shaken the entire country and each one of us,” according to aletterfrom CEO Kevin Johnson.

70,"[Claim]:A ""study showed as many as one in four people have had a package stolen from their residence.""[Evidences]:The 2019 holiday shopping season is upon us. A new NerdWallet survey estimates more than 223 million Americans (88%) plan to purchase gifts this holiday season, spending an estimated $184 billion. Of course, many of those purchases will come in brick-and-mortar stores, but increasingly shoppers are making their buys online. Some believe that trend could get a boost this year due to the short window between Black Friday and Christmas -- 26 days from Thanksgiving to Christmas, down from 32 in 2018. With that backdrop, state Rep. Rob Hutton, R-Brookfield, used the Dec. 4, 2019 GOP weekly radio address to tout his soon-to-be introduced bill to increase the penalties for stealing mail and packages. Hutton started circulating the proposed bill for co-sponsors Dec. 12, 2019. ""Of course, it’s already against the law to steal mail or any other item,"" Hutton said. ""Our laws need to keep up with the shift toward purchasing products online."" He also said: ""A recent study showed that nearly half of all gifts bought for the holidays are now purchased online. Unfortunately, another study showed as many as 1 in 4 people have had a package stolen from their residence."" Is he right about the number? The evidence When asked to provide backup for the claim, Hutton’s staff pointed us to the ""2019 Porch Package Theft Report"" by Shorr Packaging Corp., an Aurora, Ill.,-based distributor of packaging products, equipment and services. Here is what the company’s website says about the methodology: ""We surveyed 1,052 online shoppers and asked a variety of questions related to online purchasing habits, package delivery tendencies, and security as it relates to receiving goods purchased online. All respondents live in the U.S., are between the ages of 18-100 and have indicated that they purchase items online through retailers. The survey was conducted between 10/30/2019 and 10/31/2019."" Shorr Packaging teamed with marketing and analytics agency Garrison Olson on the survey. Kyle Olson, co-founder of Garrison Olson, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin the participants were selected using SurveyMonkey's audience network -- that is, people who volunteer to take surveys. The margin of error is +/- 3%. Here is the relevant line from the report: ""Nearly 1 in 4 online shoppers surveyed (24%) had personally experienced package theft, a 7% decrease compared to the 31% of self-reported package theft victims in our 2017 Package Theft report."" So, the first part of that sentence tracks with Hutton’s claim on the current number, though the second part suggests security precautions may be making a difference. Indeed, the report itself notes: More than half those surveyed had taken some sort of precautions to prevent package theft, with 45% scheduling a delivery and 33% relying on home security tools. Some 64% of victims have sent packages to a location other than their home to prevent theft. And 78% have changed their plans to be home when a package arrived, even though the package did not require a signature. The study also reported that one of the hottest items on many people’s holiday shopping list this year is a video doorbell. In fact, of the respondents who have been a victim of package theft, 41% said they had purchased a video doorbell. We did find two other sources, both of which are similar surveys, that bolster Hutton’s claim. Security.org surveyed 1,011 shoppers in mid 2019 about package delivery. Only those who have packages delivered to their homes were asked to participate. That effort found ""close to 40% of people have been the victims of so-called porch pirates, who snatch package deliveries from porches, stoops and doorsteps."" Meanwhile, home security company Canary said in its November 2019 ""Porch Pirates Beware! Report,"" nearly 1 in 5 Americans were a victim, or know someone who was a victim, of porch pirate thefts during the 2018 holiday season. Total sample size was 1,238 adults. The survey was conducted online between Oct. 24 and 25, 2019. A margin of error was not provided. Just how big is the problem? According to Security.org, federal data does not distinguish package theft from other larceny, so it’s not clear exactly how many package thefts take place every year across the country. But according to the FBI’s 2017 Crime in the United States report, the most recent annual data available, more than 5.5. Million larceny thefts were reported across the country Our ruling In the GOP radio address, Hutton said a ""study showed as many as one in four people have had a package stolen from their residence."" A trio of surveys of online shoppers supports that number, though statistics from law enforcement are hard to come by. We rate the claim True. How to avoid porch piracy Milwaukee Police Officer Jennifer Feather in a ""Cyber Monday"" message posted Dec. 2, 201,9 on the Nextdoor social network for neighborhoods, said porch piracy is preventable. ""The Milwaukee Police Department wants to remind residents to be vigilant this holiday season as packages begin to arrive on our doorsteps."" Feather also offered tips to neighbors to help thwart package thefts: 1. Keep each other updated about recent package theft activity 2. Share surveillance footage of a package theft in action 3. Ask a neighbor to pick up a package if your plans have you away from home 4. Offer to pick up a neighbor’s packages 5.

71,"[Claim]:Opposition contested Centre's statement about no infiltration case across India-China border in last 3 years by bringing up Galwan Valley violence[Evidences]:Minister of State for Home Affairs Nisith Pramanik told the Lok Sabha on December 7, 2021 that there had been no cases of infiltrations along the India-China border in the last three years, while troops from Pakistan, Nepal, Bhutan and Myanmar have infiltrated the border on several occasions. Soon after this, Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha Mallikarjun Kharge, contested Pramanik's response by highlighting the 2020 violent clash between the Indian and Chinese armies at Ladakh's Galwan Valley, which led to the loss of lives of 20 Indian military personnel . He tweeted, ""The Home Ministry has told Parliament that there has been no intrusion on Indo-China border in last 3 years. So Galwan didn't happen, our soldiers didn't die and the Chinese village in Arunachal is indeed built by BEIJING JANATA PARTY under PM Awas Yojna?"" Pramanik's response listed that in the past three years, there were 128 cases of infiltration along the India-Pakistan border, 1,787 along the India-Bangladesh border, 25 along the India-Nepal border, and 133 along the India-Myanmar border, but there were no cases of infiltration reported along the India-Bhutan and India-China border. The Home Ministry has told Parliament that there has been no intrusion on Indo-China border in last 3 years. So Galwan didn't happen, our soldiers didn't die and the Chinese village in Arunachal is indeed built by BEIJING JANATA PARTY under PM Awas Yojna? While Pramanik's response is concerned with ""infiltration"", Kharge has tweeted about ""intrusion"". Before verifying this information, FactChecker looked at what these terms mean. Defining Infiltration, Transgression & Intrusion Infiltration: Colonel Deepak Kumar , a research fellow at Manohar Parrikar Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses, defines infiltration as a ""technique of tactical movement by small forces over land, air, or water through an area or territory occupied by friendly forces or an enemy, or in the close vicinity of enemy positions. The movement is made at extended or irregular intervals. The aim of infiltration could be of temporarily occupying a feature of tactical importance, or locating a force to attack an enemy position from an unexpected direction or isolating an enemy locality for an attack by a larger follow-up force. It is inherent while infiltrating in enemy territory or close to it that contact with the enemy is avoided"". Transgression: ""When a military body of troops goes into the other side of the border assuming that it is their own territory due to the difference in the perception of the border itself,"" defined the officer, who was involved in counter insurgency operations in Kashmir as part of Operation Rakshak. Intrusion: Using an open-source definition, Col Kumar explains that intrusion is ""movement of a unit or force or a military asset inside another nation's specified operational area or territorial seas or territorial airspace for surveillance or intelligence gathering in times of peace, no war-no peace, or war. A characteristic feature of intrusion is that it is temporary in time and space and has to be vacated (or evicted)"". India-China Border Battle The India-China border spans over 3,488 kilometres, according to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs' Annual Report 2019-20 . China also claims approximately 90,000 sq kms of Indian territory in Arunachal Pradesh, and has occupied approximately 38,000 sq kms of Indian territory in Ladakh, said Minister of State for External Affairs Vellamvelly Muraleedharan in Lok Sabha on March 11, 2020. China is also in possession of 5,180 sq kms of Indian territory in Pakistan Occupied Kashmir due to the China-Pakistan 'Boundary Agreement' dated March 2, 1963, Muraleedharan told the lower house of Parliament. However, there is no commonly delineated Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas between India and China, said Shripad Naik, former MoS for Defence, on November 27, 2019. Naik also said that India and China both ""have differing perceptions of LAC"" and ""due to both sides undertaking patrolling up to their respective perceptions of the LAC, transgressions do occur"". Who is Correct: Pramanik or Kharge? According to Pramanik, no cases of infiltration occurred along the India-China border in the last three years and Kharge contested that by bringing up Galwan violence, which he called a case of intrusion. But, in a statement on September 15, 2020, Union Defence Minister Rajnath Singh said the Chinese violated the agreement they made with India on June 6, 2020, which was to abide by the premeditated LAC. ""China does not accept the customary and traditional alignment of the boundary between India and China"" and that, as of September 15, 2020, there was ""no commonly delineated Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the border areas between India and China and there is no common perception of the entire LAC"", Singh told Lok Sabha. The Union minister also mentioned the Galwan Valley violence and said there was a face-off between the two sides. ""The Chinese side had taken action to hinder the normal, traditional patrolling pattern of our troops in the Galwan Valley area,"" said Singh. While adding that while the situation was being addressed, as per the provisions of agreements between the two nations, he said, ""Chinese side made several attempts to transgress the LAC in other parts of the Western Sector. This included Kongka La, Gogra and North Bank of Pangong Lake. These attempts were detected early and consequently responded to appropriately by our armed forces."" Singh also explained the reason for the clash. ""Given the growing friction along the LAC, the Senior Commanders of the two sides in a meeting on June 6, 2020 agreed on a process of disengagement that involved reciprocal actions. Both sides also agreed to respect and abide by the LAC and not undertake any activity to alter the status quo. However, in violation of this the Chinese side created a violent face off on June 15 at Galwan. Our brave soldiers laid down their lives and also inflicted costs including casualties on the Chinese side"". Former MoS Naik had also told Lok Sabha in 2019 that between 2016 and 2018, there were 1,025 transgressions by the Chinese soldiers, with no casualties reported. The definition, Singh's statement and numbers presented by Naik altogether show that since both countries do not agree upon the LAC and there is a difference in perception of the border, the Chinese actions can be categorised as acts of transgressions and not intrusion or infiltration.

74,"[Claim]:Viral Post Makes Misleading Claims About Police Injuries For Jan. 6 Attack, George Floyd Protesters[Evidences]:A postshared on Facebookclaims 85 Capitol Police officers and 65 DC Metro police officers were injured during the night of May 29, 2020.



Verdict: Misleading

While St. John’s Church was set on fire and former President Donald Trump did go into a bunker, the number of police officers injured is from the Jan. 6 attack, not May 29, 2020.

Fact Check:

A large group of Trump supporters intruded into the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election, according toThe Washington Post. Several police officers received the Congressional Gold Medal for their actions on Jan. 6, the outlet reported.

The post attempts to juxtapose the Jan. 6 attack with the George Floyd protesters. The claim also appeared onTwitter, being shared more than 1,400 times.

“The Jan 6 cops are getting congressional gold metal. The left on 5/29/2020 in DC: > 150 officers injured: 86 Capitol Police and 65 members of the DC Metropolitan Police Department. They set fire to St John’s church and a Whitehouse guard post. Trump had to be sent to a bunker,” the post reads.

This comparison, however, is misleading. The Capitol Police and the DC Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) suffered a combined 150 injuries during the Jan. 6 attack, according toCBS News. The Capitol Police suffered 86 injuries while MPD suffered 65 injuries, the outlet reported.(RELATED: Did Senator John Kennedy Present A Letter During The January 6 Hearing That Implicated Adam Schiff?)

Alaina Gertz, a spokesperson for the MPD, told Check Your Fact via email, “I think this tweet is referencing the injuries that occurred at the Capitol on January 6thbecause we have confirmed on the record that 65 MPD members sustained injuries documented in injury reports in connection the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.”

“Zero officers were injured during the protests on May 29, 2020. Regarding the Floyd protests, we recorded 24 officer injuries from protests on May 31 & June 1 of 2020,” Gertz continued.

17 protesters were arrested and 11 MPD police officers were injured on the night of May 30, according toThe Associated Press. Protesters vandalized businesses and threw objects at police officers, the outlet reported.

It is true there were reports that a White House guard post was set on fire on the night of May 31, according toThe Hill. It is also true that a building at St. John’s Church was set on fire, NBC Washingtonreported. Trump was also in a bunker beneath the White House for nearly an hour May 30, The Associated Pressreported.

75,"[Claim]:""80% of the R2 billion spent by the Western Cape Government on tenders during 2012/2013 was paid to #BEEbusinesses. #DAdelivers""[Evidences]:In February 2014, Africa Check published a column which questioned the sourcing of various pre-election claims being made on Twitter by South Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance (DA). The DA's then social media manager, Alex Molteno, said the party strives to ensure that any claims its makes are accurate and added that if Africa Check ""finds that any of these statistics are inaccurate, we will gladly rectify them."" Many of the DA's claims relate to its performance in the Western Cape, the only province in the country that is not held by the governing African National Congress. This report - the first of two on the DA - evaluates a number of key claims made by the party on Twitter using the hashtag #DADelivers. It forms part of a series of fact-checks of leading political parties and politicians to be published by Africa Check in the run-up to the elections on May 7 2014. Claim ""In the 2nd half of 2012/13, the WC Provincial Govt. created 60,000 work opportunities via the Expanded Public Works Projects. #DAdelivers"" Verdict incorrect The DA's former social media manager, Alex Molteno, said the claim was based on the Expanded Public Works Programme's second quarterly report for 2012/13 .  But according to that report,  68,044 work opportunities were created in the Western Cape in the first half of 2012/13, not the second half as stated in the DA's tweet. If the claim was based on the first half of the year, then it understated performance. The third and fourth quarterly reports - which cover the second half of the year - have yet to be released and it is unclear how many work opportunities were created then. Claim ""@DA_News municipalities have created 31,000 job opportunities in the past year. #DAdelivers"" Verdict unproven This claim appears to have first been tweeted by Gavin Davis, the DA's communications director, on 1 March 2013 . It was then recycled by the DA which tweeted it on several different dates including 18 September , 2 October , 18 November and 30 December 2013. The claim was also included in the party's 2014 election manifesto , which was launched in February 2014. It is therefore unclear whether the claim refers to a calendar year, a financial year or a specific 12 month period. If it was the latter, then - given the fact that the tweet was used on several different dates - which 12 month period did it refer to? According to the DA, the claim is supported by the Expanded Public Works Programme's second quarterly report for 2012/13 .  But that report states that 18,104 work opportunities were created in Western Cape district and metropolitan municipalities between 1 April 2012 and 30 September 2013. A further 7,491 work opportunities were created during the same period in Western Cape local municipalities. Add them together and you get a total of 25, 595. Claim ""W Cape has best delivery record in SA: 99.1% of households access piped water, 93.4% electricity & 96.9% have toilet facilities. #DAdelivers"" Verdict mostly-correct According to the DA, the claim is supported by data collected during South Africa's 2011 national census . The census found that 99.1% of households in the Western Cape had access to piped water. Just behind the Western Cape was Gauteng province, where 98.2% of households were found to have had access to piped water. According to the census, 93.4% of Western Cape households used electricity for lighting, compared to 91.1% in the Free State and 87.4% in Gauteng. However, when it came to accessing toilets, the Western Cape slipped from first place. According to the census, 98.9% of Gauteng households had access to a toilet. In the Western Cape 96.9% of households had access to toilets. (An earlier Africa Check report evaluated similar claims about water access made by the national government.) Claim ""The City of Cape Town delivers more to poor residents than any other city in the country. #DAdelivers"" Verdict unproven The DA says the claim is supported by a 2011 report on household access to basic services which was compiled by the national government's Department of Co-operative Government and Traditional Affairs. The report, which in fact used data from 2009, ranked the City of Cape Town first in the country for providing services to households. It stated that 90% of households there had achieved basic service levels and 88% had achieved higher service levels. It's important to note that the report referred to ""the levels of household access to basic service"" throughout the city and did not refer specifically to poor residents. Andre Bothma, the DA's marketing director,  told Africa Check that the claim was also supported by the City of Cape Town's Mid-Year Review (2011-2013) which stated that ""[t]he City of Cape Town has the best record of any metro in the country for providing basic services, and providing financial relief to the poor"". However, the review provided no evidence or data to support the claim and it is unclear how it arrived at its conclusion that the city had the ""best record of any metro in the country"". The 2012 non-financial census of municipalities revealed that the Western Cape has the highest percentage of households in the country receiving free basic water, electricity and sewerage and sanitation. Claim ""The [South African] gap between the 'haves' & the 'havenots' is smallest in City of Cape Town. It has the highest level of equality in SA. #DAdelivers"" Verdict mostly-correct The DA based the claim on the 2010/2011 State of the World's Cities report produced by UN-Habitat, the United Nations Human Settlements Programme. The report, which used the Gini coefficient to compare inequality between cities, suggested that East London and Johannesburg were some of the most unequal cities in the world. While Cape Town was found to have high levels of inequality by world standards, it was found to be the least unequal of the South African cities examined for the report.  Of the South African cities analysed, Cape Town had the lowest Gini coefficient at 0.67 while East London and Johannesburg had the highest Gini coefficients at 0.75. The 2012/2013 State of the World's Cities report found that Cape Town was a more broadly prosperous city than Johannesburg, the only other South African city examined. Claim ""Of the R18 billion spent on service delivery in the City of Cape Town, R11billion is spent on the poor communities. #DAdelivers"" Verdict unproven Andre Bothma, the DA's marketing director, said the claim was based on a 2012 City of Cape Town expenditure analysis. He told Africa Check the document is not publicly available. (This contradicts a statement by Molteno, the DA's former social media manager, who told us that the DA keeps a database of ""DA delivery facts, each accompanied by a reference to a source for it that is publicly available "".) Bothma also referred us to a September 2012 speech by Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille in which the claim was made. But De Lille made no reference to the source of the claim. Her spokesman, Solly Malatsi, said the claim was taken from the City of Cape Town's 2012/13 budget using ""data analytics models"". ""Using the basis of service delivery departments as the quantum of focus, we then tabulate expenditure patterns using a ward analysis of geographical income distributions in the City matched against a formula of total spending amounts to arrive at the percentage-based figure,"" he explained. Africa Check has been unable to independently verify the accuracy of claim. Claim ""80% of the R2 billion spent by the Western Cape Government on tenders during 2012/2013 was paid to #BEEbusinesses. #DAdelivers"" Verdict correct The DA says the claim is based on a Western Cape government analysis of expenditure .The analysis states that '[i]n the 2012/13 financial year, the majority of tenders over R100 000 were awarded to BEE firms. In total, bids worth R1.6 billion went to BEE firms"". This amounts to 80% of the total. Claim ""65% of the Western Cape Govt's senior management are previously disadvantaged South Africans. #DAdelivers"" Verdict unproven The DA claims that the tweet was sourced from the 2013 ""Western Cape Human Resource Database"". Bothma told Africa Check that the database was not publicly accessible. When asked if there were other documents that supported the claim, Bothma directed us to a Times LIVE article and a City Press article in which the Western Cape premier and DA leader, Helen Zille, claimed that ""77 percent of our 50,521 senior employees fell within the designated 'black group'"". No source for that claim was provided. We have been unable to independently verify the accuracy of the claim. Claim ""76% of the Western Cape Government's budget is redistributed to poor communities. #DAdelivers"" Verdict unproven Bothma referred Africa Check to a presentation compiled by Western Cape Premier Helen Zille's office on provincial ' expenditure on the poor '. However, the source provided does not support the claim. The presentation, delivered by Helen Zille in August 2012, claims that an analysis of a representative sample of departments revealed that 76% of their budgets were redistributed to poor communities. Only the departments of health, education, human settlements, social development and cultural affairs and sport were considered in the analysis. Expenditure in eight other provincial departments was not analysed. Claim ""8 of the top 10 South African municipalities in the Municipal IQ's Productivity Index are governed by @DA_News. #DAdelivers"" Verdict mostly-correct This claim has been tweeted a number of times since November 2013 and is said to have been taken from Municipal IQ's 2013 Productivity Index. Municipal IQ is an independent data service that monitors and assesses South Africa municipalities. The claim is not strictly correct (though it is close) as the index shows that six of the ten top-performing local municipalities are run by the DA and one is run by a DA-Cope coalition. Claim ""In its first four years in government, the DA-governed City of Cape Town tripled the number of houses delivered per year. #DAdelivers"" Verdict mostly-correct The DA said that the claim was sourced from the Cape Town Story , a booklet published by the DA in March 2011. It claimed that ""the post-2006 City government has built three times the number of houses its predecessor managed"". Frouwien Bosman, a DA policy researcher, told Africa Check that the claim was based on comparing the average number of houses delivered under the ANC to the number delivered under the DA in 2008/09 and 2009/10. In 2003/04 , 2004/05 and 2005/06 , the last three years the ANC ran the City of Cape Town, an average of 3,287 housing opportunities were provided, according to the city's annual reports. Under the DA , 9,576 housing opportunities were delivered in the city in 2008/09 and 8,950 housing opportunities were delivered in 2009/10. In 2010/11 and 2011/12 , the number of housing opportunities delivered dropped to 7,472 and 7,141 respectively. Claim ""The W Cape Govt spends R33.6mil on its Premier's Advancement of Youth Project & its youth wage subsidy programme every year. #DADelivers"" Verdict mostly-correct Bothma told Africa Check that the ""youth wage subsidy programme"" that the tweet refers to is the Western Cape Department of Economic Development and Tourism's ""Work and Skills Programme"". Bronwynne Jooste, a spokesperson for the Western Cape provincial minister of finance, economic development and tourism, Alan Winde, told Africa Check that R10-million was spent each year on the programme in 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12. Expenditure decreased to R8.9-million in 2012/13 and R13.4-million was spent on the programme in 2013/14. Jooste couldn't provide a document or an audit to support the figures. She said that the Work and Skills Programme's expenditure was not accounted for separately in the department's financial statements and was included under the broader category of ""workforce development"". The Premier's Advancement of Youth Project started in 2012/13. Zak Mbhele, Zille's spokesman in her capacity as Premier,  told Africa Check that R23,1-million is spent every year on the Premier's Advancement of Youth Project. This, he said, was based on paying 750 interns R2,400 per month for 12 months. An annual amount of R1,5-million is also allocated for administrative costs. But Mbhele was unable to provide documentation to support the figure.  ""…[T]he remuneration expenditure on the [Premier's Advancement of Youth Project] is part and parcel of personnel costs across all departments and is not reflected in a separate, collated document,"" he explained via email. If the figures provided by Jooste and Mbhele are correct, it would appear that a combined total of R32-million was spent in 2012/13 financial year and  a further R36.5 million in 2013/14. These figures are close to, but not in line with, the R33.6-million per year that the DA's claim refers to. It is unclear how the DA calculated that figure.

Florida has awarded 11,000 teachers more than $33 million for completing civics training offered by@EducationFL.

Congratulations to all the educators who have finished this training and received bonuses – we are glad you are taking civics seriously!

— Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis)July 9, 2023



Verdict: True

A press release shared to both DeSantis’ and the Florida Department of Education’s websites indicates 11,000 teachers have received $33 million for completing the training. A March release from the Florida Department of Education noted that 4,500 teachers had completed the training at the time.

Fact Check:

DeSantis said he’s “not a No. 2 guy” when asked if he would be former President Donald Trump’s running mate in the 2024 election, according toThe New York Times. DeSantis, who is also a 2024 hopeful, is currently trailing Trump by 30 percentage points in national polls,Reutersreported.

“Florida has awarded 11,000 teachers more than $33 million for completing civics training offered by@EducationFL,” DeSantis wrote in a Jul. 9 tweet that has been viewed more than 500,000 times. “Congratulations to all the educators who have finished this training and received bonuses – we are glad you are taking civics seriously!” he said.

A press release shared to bothDeSantis’and theFlorida Department of Education’swebsites indeed confirms that 11,000 teachers have received $33 million for completing the training. The teachers who received the money either participated in the Summer Civics Professional Learning Series or the Civics Seal of Excellence Endorsement, according to the same release.

AMarch releasefrom the Florida Department of Education noted that 4,500 teachers had completed the training at the time. These teachers participated in the Civics Seal of Excellence Endorsement course and received a $3,000 bonus, the release indicated. In addition, the release stated more than 10,000 teachers had registered for the course the first week it was available.

In July 2021, DeSantisannounced$106 million would be used to establish the Civic Literary Excellence Initiative. The funding is used to award Florida teachers with the Civics Seal of Excellence and provide them with the $3,000 bonus.(RELATED: Was George Soros At An Event Supporting Ron DeSantis?)

In the press release announcing that 11,000 teachers had completed civics training and received bonuses, DeSantis stressed the importance of preparing children to be “great citizens.”

“We have a responsibility to ensure our students are prepared to be great citizens,” the Republican Florida Governor said.

“That is why we created a new civics curriculum in Florida and are making this important investment of more than $106 million. By July 4, 2026, our country’s 250thanniversary, we will make sure every K-12 student in Florida is educated with our new civics curriculum,” he added.

According to the course’sofficial website, it is 55 hours in length and can be completed entirely online. The course is composed of video modules and features 53 expert speakers, including DeSantis.

77,"[Claim]:Did Moderna’s CEO State The Company Manufactured 100,000 COVID-19 Vaccine Doses In 2019?[Evidences]:A videoshared on Facebookclaims Moderna’s CEO Stephen Bancel stated the company manufactured 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019.



Verdict: False

Bancel was referring to all vaccine doses manufactured in 2019, not COVID-19 vaccine doses.

Fact Check:

SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was detected in China in December 2019, though there are some reports that the virus started to circulate in November 2019, according to theLos Angeles Times. Advisors for the Food and Drug Administration expressed disappointment after booster shot data was not presented last year,CNNreported.

The Facebook video claims that Bancel stated that the pharmaceutical company manufactured 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses in 2019.(RELATED: Did Karine Jean-Pierre Leave A Press Conference After Being Asked About Classified Documents?)

The claim that Bancel said the company manufactured 100,000 COVID-19 vaccine doses is false. During a Davos Jan. 18 forum, Bancel was asked about the company’s ability to manufacture COVID-19 vaccine doses.

“When the pandemic happened, Moderna had made 100,000 dose in 2019 for the whole year. And I remember walking after Davos into the office of my head of manufacturing and I say ‘how we make a billion dose next year?’ And he look at me a bit funny and say, ‘What?’ I say, ‘yeah, we have to make a billion doses next year, there is going to be a pandemic,” Bancel said.

The quote is taken out of context. A Moderna spokesperson told Check Your Fact in an email that the “claims are not accurate” and that Bancel was referring to “100K doses across our portfolio – rare diseases, cancer, etc.,” not the amount of COVID-19 vaccines produced during the year.

Moderna had at least four vaccines in clinical trials in 2019, according tovariouspressreleases. Moderna previously stated in 2021 it would manufacture up to one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses, according toStat News. There areno credible news reportssuggesting their COVID-19 vaccine was being manufactured before the pandemic was declared.

This is not the first time misinformation about Moderna has circulated on social media. Check Your Fact previouslyreportedthat the company was developing a COVID-19 vaccine in January 2020.",False,False

Reported by CNSNews.com The basis for this claim, footnoted in the report, was an April 12, 2012, news article posted online by the CNSNews.com, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said by email. The Virginia-based service says its goal is to ""provide an alternative news source that would cover stories that are subject to the bias of omission and report on other news subject to bias by commission."" According to the story, ""Shovel Ready in San Fran: $205,075 to ‘Translocate’ One Shrub from Path of Stimulus Project,"" various agencies in 2010 transplanted a type of bush spotted in San Francisco that until then had been believed extinct in the wild for more than 60 years; the shrub was moved from a highway median where it blocked a stimulus-supported highway renovation to an undisclosed local location where it could continue to bloom in the wild. Meantime, the story said, commercial versions of the Franciscan manzanita, or Arctostaphylos franciscana, could be purchased locally for $15.98 or $18 each. An article about the uncovered plant, on the web page for a Los Angeles botanical garden, says Franciscan manzanitas typically grow about 12 inches tall and spread by rooting branches to form masses from 4 to 6 feet (or more) wide. According to the description, white- to pink-blushed urn-shaped flowers are produced in small terminal clusters. CNSNews.com quoted a spokeswoman for the Presidio Parkway project, Molly Graham, as saying that digging up the uncovered plant, putting it on a truck and driving and planting it elsewhere cost $100,000. The story noted other plant-related costs in a Dec. 21, 2009, 15-year memorandum of agreement involving various agencies teamed up to save and propagate the plant found near the south entrance to the Golden Gate Bridge. In the agreement, the California Department of Transportation, or CalTrans, agreed to transfer $79,470 to ""fund the establishment, nurturing, and monitoring of the Mother Plant in its new location for a period not to exceed ten (10) years following relocation and two (2) years for salvaged rooted layers and cuttings…"" Receiving the money: the federal Presidio Trust, which describes itself as devoted to transforming the Presidio section of San Francisco to a new purpose. CalTrans also agreed to transfer $25,605 to the trust to cover reporting requirements of the initial 10-year period. Adding these figures to the $100,000 to uproot, move and re-plant the shrub leads to total translocation costs of $205,075, CNSNews.com said, not counting up to $23,500 in other post-move shrub-connected costs it identified from the memo. Stimulus money contributed to road project And how did the Obama administration figure in? CNSNews.com reported that grants funded by the economic stimulus package, approved by the Democratic-majority Congress and signed into law by Obama in 2009, are helping to fund the ongoing replacement of an approach to the Golden Gate bridge, which has a total expected cost of $1.045 billion. Some $130 million in stimulus grants, the story said, breaks down to $83.28 million awarded Dec. 24, 2009 (about a month before the bush move) and $46 million awarded Dec. 30, 2010. Our hunt for other accounts of the shrub shift yielded an earlier news story pegging the costs of the shrub move at $175,000--""$140,000 to dig up and move the shrub, and $35,000 for ‘support’ services from geological, botanical and climate experts in preparation for its new home in the Presidio less than a mile away,"" according to a San Francisco Chronicle news story posted online June 2, 2010. Like the CNSNews.com article, the Chronicle story was silent on whether stimulus aid paid for the shrub move. Plant in wild distinct from commercially cultivated version? Separately, botanists declared a difference between the plant found in the wild and others like it. In an April 20, 2012, blog post, the Berkeley, Calif.-based Bay Nature Institute, which says it’s dedicated to educating residents about the beauty of the surrounding natural world, quoted Dan Gluesenkamp, the botanist who originally noticed the lone plant as he drove by the median, as saying it’s misleading to equate the wild Franciscan manzanita with the domesticated version found in garden stores, which has been hybridized for features like pretty flowers, Gluesenkamp said. ""You can go buy a dog for $15 or $230,"" he said, ""but it’s not the same as a wolf in the wild."" The blog post continued: ""The Franciscan manzanita found in garden stores is an offshoot of a wild specimen taken in 1947 from a Laurel Hill cemetery, one of the few remaining wild locations at the time. As the story goes, some of the last remaining wild specimens were salvaged by James Roof, the founding director of the Regional Parks Botanic Garden in Berkeley. In a clandestine nighttime rescue, plantswoman Lester Rowntree ‘garnered it ghoulishly in a gunnysack’ and gave it a new home in her garden. A few more plants found their way into nurseries and botanic gardens, but the species’ known wild habitat was no more,"" the institute said. In September 2012, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated the surviving wild manzanita as an endangered species, according to a Sept. 4, 2012, Chronicle news article. Agency: Shrub's move covered by local road tolls Asked how the shrub's move was funded, a CalTrans official, David Yam, replied by email that $148,000 spent to uproot the 21,000-pound plant and move, replant and initially preserve it came from tolls collected on bridges near San Francisco by the Bay Area Toll Authority--not stimulus aid. Yam said major post-move costs, in accord with the memorandum of agreement, are drawing on $105,000 in federal funds, though (again) no stimulus money, he said. Shopping for a Franciscan manzanita Yam agreed a similar cultivated Manzanita plant can be purchased commercially, but he said a 21,000-pound wild Manzanita isn't available. He provided a background document stating the plant discovered on the median is one of three remaining ""wild"" species of the bush; the others are in botanical gardens, the document states. ""Cuttings from the 'wild' plant cannot be purchased by the public,"" the document states. We briefly shopped online for a manzanita Franciscana without finding one. By telephone, Bart O’Brien, a manager at the Regional Parks Botanic Garden in Berkeley, Calif., said that occasionally the garden sells plants, descended from the manzanita Franciscana salvaged from the San Francisco cemetery in the 1940s. When sales happen, he said, the plants sell for $10 to $25. The sold plants are of the same species as the bush saved during the ongoing highway project, O'Brien said, but they’re not the same because they're not growing in the wild. Cruz unmoved Updated on our findings, Frazier said by email the bush never would have been shifted if not for the stimulus-supported road project. Moving the plant wasted tax dollars, she said, and Cruz stands by his claim. Our ruling Cruz said the Obama administration spent ""$205,075 in ‘stimulus’ to relocate a shrub that sells for $16."" Some $130 million in stimulus money is supporting a $1 billion California road project that when it started brought to light a thought-to-be-extinct shrub in the wild. But we learned local road toll revenues covered the shrub’s $148,000 move and transplantation--not stimulus aid. Also, there’s a distinction between the rare in-the-wild version the shrub ballyhooed in the city by the bay and the occasionally available commercial versions, which this claim fails to acknowledge. We rate the statement, which has an element of truth but ignores critical facts such as the singularity of the shrub whose move wasn't funded from stimulus aid, as Mostly False.

Examples are viewable on Twitter (here) and Facebook (here), with one popular tweet reading, “The Netherlands is seizing privately owned farm land. In protest, Dutch farmers are spraying government buildings and riot police with MANURE! We could learn from the Dutch.” The video does not show a recent protest in the Netherlands, however, nor does it depict protesters throwing manure on police. It is not the first time this clip has been miscaptioned to say it shows farmers protesting in the Netherlands (here) Reuters could not find the exact video viewable in the social media posts, but it shows the same scene as seen in other footage of a Sept 7, 2015 protest filmed by the Associated Press (here), (www.bit.ly/3C9ZNUw). The video was shot on the Schuman roundabout in Brussels, Belgium, near the European Commission headquarters known as the Berlaymont building and European Council building (goo.gl/maps/kEH7cBMt8D6j8mFN8) Reuters images of demonstrators at the same location that day captured police officers being sprayed by hay, not manure as is claimed online (here), (here). Another video by outlet New Europe, seemingly depicting the same scene as the clip shared online (youtu.be/14vowMfvrIs?t=26), also shows the tractor throwing hay at police officers. On Sept. 7, 2015, Reuters reported that nearly 5,000 European farmers from multiple countries, including the Netherlands, marched on European Union buildings in Brussels to demand support for a sector that was hit by a Russian ban on EU food imports, including dairy products (here). Outlets including Al Jazeera (here) and The Guardian (here) also reported at the time that farmers were protesting over low dairy and meat prices.

81,"[Claim]:New York State Assembly is not voting on a bill on Jan. 5, 2022 to indefinitely detain unvaccinated people[Evidences]:The New York State Assembly is not voting on a bill in January 2022 to indefinitely detain unvaccinated individuals at the governor’s will, despite claims being made online. Users and blogs have referred to a bill (A.416) first proposed in 2015 (here) that aimed to amend public health law “in relation to the removal of cases, contacts and carriers of communicable diseases who are potentially dangerous to the public health” and is viewable (here). One user said on Twitter: “New York Legislation votes Jan 5 to provide indefinite detention of unvaccinated. What happened to ‘Land of the Free’?” (here). Others shared a screenshot of a since-updated article published on the website ‘The National Pulse,’ that claimed the New York Senate and Assembly would be voting on such a bill on Jan. 5, 2022 (here). Another user said: “If you live in the state of New York, PLEASE GET OUT. The New York State Legislation will vote on January 5th of 2022 whether or not to detain unvaccinated individuals at Gov. Hochul’s discretion. This insane authoritarianism cannot be sustained. The people must fight back” (here). No such bill is being voted on in the New York State Assembly on Jan. 5, 2022. The legislative session begins on that date (here), (here). The bill being shared online was first proposed in 2015, sponsored by New York Assembly Member N. Nick Perry following the outbreak of Ebola and does not mention the term ‘unvaccinated’ (here). The A.416 bill would have allowed for the “removal and detention of cases, contacts and carriers who are or may be a danger to public health” during a public health emergency. In a statement released in 2020, Perry said the bill had first been introduced after it was discovered that people infected with Ebola had entered the United States, although there were elements of the bill that could be applicable to the COVID-19 pandemic (here). Following its initial proposal, the bill was reintroduced in the 2017-2018, 2019-2020, and 2021-2022 legislative sessions (here), (here), (here), (here). Since it was first presented in 2015, the bill has remained in stalemate and never moved beyond the committee stage to the Assembly Floor. The bill has also only been proposed by Perry and has never had a co-sponsor. For a bill to become law, it would have to progress through introduction, a committee stage and passage through the Assembly before being signed into law by the Governor (here). Perry announced his intention to remove the bill from the calendar through a statement published via his social media channels on Dec. 21, 2021 (here), (here). He confirmed this to Reuters via email as well. Per a statement to Reuters from Assembly Member Richard Gottfried, Chair of the Assembly Health Committee, the committee “does not plan to put the bill on an agenda … This bill has been introduced every year since 2015, has never been taken up by the Committee, has not been cosponsored by other legislators, and has not had a companion bill in the Senate”, according to Gottfried’s office. The claim that assembly members would be voting to pass the bill also circulated in January 2021 and was debunked by PolitiFact (here). The National Pulse, quoted by some social media posts making the claim, issued a correction on their article which reads: “A previous version of this article mentioned a vote on the bill on January 5th 2022, that is the date of the legislative session in general, not the date of the vote on Bill A416.” (archive.md/QeWw7)",False,True
82,"[Claim]:Rajnath Singh requested people not to assault or throw shoes on their leaders campaigning for the upcoming 2022 elections in Uttar Pradesh[Evidences]:A screenshot of a newspaper article is being shared on social media claiming that BJP leader Rajnath Singh, in a recent public meeting, requested people not to assault or throw shoes on their leaders campaigning for the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh. In the wake of the upcoming assembly elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab, this post is widely shared on social media. Let’s verify the claim made in the post. The archived version of the post can be seen here. Claim: Rajnath Singh requested people not to assault or throw shoes on their leaders campaigning for the upcoming 2022 elections in Uttar Pradesh. Fact: BJP leader Rajnath Singh had made these statements during the 2017 Punjab election campaign rally in Abohar, Punjab. Following the incident of shoe-throwing at the then Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, Rajnath Singh made this request to opposition party supporters in Punjab. The news article shared in the post is old and has nothing to do with the upcoming elections in Uttar Pradesh. Hence, the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. When we searched for relevant sources using relevant keywords, it is found that BJP leader Rajnath Singh had made these statements during the 2017 Punjab election campaign rally in Abohar, Punjab. Several social media users shared the live visuals of Rajnath Singh making this statement in the Abohar rally. They can be seen here and here. Following the incidents of stone-pelting on the convoy of Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) chief Sukhbir Singh Badal and shoe-throwing at the then Punjab Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal, Rajnath Singh while addressing the Abohar rally said, “Aapko vote na dena ho toh mat dijiye,lekin kya aap unpe (Prakash Singh Badal) lathi chalayenge,joote phekenge?” (when translated to English: If you wish not to vote for him, don’t vote, but do not throw shoes on him). ‘ANI’ tweeted this statement made by Rajnath Singh on 24 January 2017. The live video visuals of Rajnath Singh’s speech at the Abohar rally can be seen here and here. Aapko vote na dena ho toh mat dijiye,lekin kya aap unpe (Parkash Singh Badal) lathi chalayenge,joote phekenge?-HM Rajnath Singh #Punjabpolls — ANI (@ANI) January 24, 2017 Further, Rajnath Singh said, “It pains me. Stones being thrown and the shoe being hurled, is this humanity? No matter how big our opponents may be, but everyone must not violate rule of law… Is it okay for people that someone may come and hurl a shoe at Parkash Singh Badal,, I want to ask Congress people… Sardar Badal is an elderly statesman”. Several other news websites had reported this statement made by Rajnath Singh during the Abohar rally in 2017. They can be seen here and here. From all these pieces of evidence, it can be concluded that the newspaper article shared in the post reports Rajnath Singh’s old statement made during the 2017 Punjab Assembly Election campaign in Abohar, not related to the upcoming assembly 2022 elections in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. To sum it up, Rajnath Singh’s old statement during the 2017 Punjab election campaign linked to the upcoming assembly elections.",False,True

84,"[Claim]:Facebook photos of a so-called “baby deposit box” that surfaced in summer 2022 were genuine depictions of a site in Namibia for new parents to leave unwanted newborns.[Evidences]:In August 2022, readers asked us to confirm or disprove the legitimacy of pictures in a popular Facebook post that claimed to show a so-called “baby deposit box” in Namibia for new parents to leave their unwanted newborns “instead of dumping them.” We soon found that the story and photographs were real. The Facebook post, with which hundreds of thousands of accounts had engaged as of this writing, documented a real endeavor by a Swakopmund couple named Ronel and Dick Peters. Snopes was able to authenticate the Facebook post’s images by cross-referencing them with tweets that the couple had sponsored more than a year earlier, in April 2021. For those reasons, we rated this claim “True.” The story dates back to 2018. At that time, the couple decided to open their home to “babies who [were] not wanted by their mothers,” according to reporting from The Namibian. A nonprofit called the Ruach Elohim Foundation grew from the idea. The “baby deposit box,” known to them as their “baby saver box,” was built with the foundation’s logo placed on the front side: Done! pic.twitter.com/CvHvmyb82G The foundation is described on its official Facebook page as “a voluntary association in Namibia focusing on the awareness of baby dumping, as well as the care of unwanted, abandoned,abused, and neglected babies.” The Namibian reported in 2019: Ruach Elohim means ‘Breath of God’ in Hebrew. The foundation was registered with the Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare as a place of safety. ‘We decided to open our house to take care of unwanted, neglected, vulnerable, and abandoned babies. This foundation was registered as a means to help stop baby dumping and to prevent babies from dying a horrible and lonely death by the very hands of those who were supposed to take care of them,’ said the founder, 46-year-old Ronel Peters. Peters, who has left her job as a pharmaceutical medical representative, and moved with her husband from Windhoek to Swakopmund to create a safe home, became even more concerned and determined to continue her mission following recent reports of child dumping in the media. In April 2021, the foundation’s official Twitter account posted a thread promoting its efforts. The thread included photos that later appeared in the above-displayed Facebook post: This is our story, we are pleased to share it with you all as we begin our journey here on twitter. We are making a difference one baby at time. Please help Retweet and spread for awareness.

According to the foundation’s Facebook page, as of July 2022, seven babies had been left in the “baby saver box”: We reached out to the Ruach Elohim Foundation with several questions about their efforts and will update this story if we receive a response. In sum, yes, a family in Namibia had installed a so-called “baby deposit box” as seen in photos in a viral Facebook post. They called it a “baby saver box,” and their foundation said it had saved the lives of seven babies who may otherwise have been aborted, abandoned, or neglected.

85,"[Claim]:""You have literally 140 people dying every day of opioid-related overdoses.""[Evidences]:As cases of opioid use disorder continue to wreak havoc across the U.S., many states have taken steps to address the issue. Missouri is one of more than 30 states that brought a lawsuit against opioid manufacturers, alleging the companies misrepresented the dangerous and addictive nature of the drugs. Speaking at a roundtable discussion about the opioid epidemic Nov. 25, Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, who inherited Missouri’s lawsuit when he took office, said, ""You have literally 140 people dying every day of opioid-related overdoses. That’s like a passenger plane going down every day of every week of every month of every year of every decade."" Stating that 140 deaths per day are caused by opioid-related overdoses emphasizes the high stakes of the opioid crisis, so we wanted to see if Schmitt’s number was correct. Here’s what we found: He’s off by about 10. Preliminary data for last year shows fewer deaths. When asked about where Schmitt found the statistic, Chris Nuelle, the attorney general’s press secretary, said that opioid-related research can fluctuate, so it can be hard to get exact numbers. He also noted that Schmitt has often attributed 130 deaths per day to opioids, though Nuelle believes the 140 number is still accurate. Nuelle pointed to aNational Institute on Drug Abuse articlethat attributed more than 130 deaths per day and provided the link to a U.S. News & World Report story that analyzed opioid data, but did not indicate the number of deaths due to opioid overdoses each day at all. The most reliable and most recent data available on drug and opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC’s most recent data was released in 2018 and analyzes 2017 drug and opioid overdose deaths. In 2017, there were 70,237 drug overdose deaths in the United States. Of those deaths, 47,600 — or 67.8% of all drug overdose deaths — involved some type of opioids whether natural, synthetic or semisynthetic. When you break these statistics down into deaths per day, there were approximately 192 drug overdose deaths each day on average in 2017. Of those 192 deaths, about 130 each day involved an opioid. This statistic does not match up exactly with Schmitt’s claim that there are 140 opioid-related deaths daily in the U.S. Jasmine Reed, a public affairs specialist at the CDC, said in an email that the 130 daily deaths from opioid overdoses is an average calculated by dividing the total number of opioid overdoses in the year by the number of days in a year. She said this means the number is not an absolute figure, but that it is more accurate to say there are 130 opioid overdose deaths in the U.S. each day than it is to say there are 140. The CDC estimates that between 1999 and 2017, more than 702,000 people have died from a drug overdose, and about 399,000 of those deaths were due to opioid overdoses. Overall, the number of opioid overdose deaths each day and drug overdose deaths each day have both been steadily increasing within that time period. If the number of opioid overdose deaths continued growing steadily, as it has in past years, the number of deaths each day in 2019 might, in fact, be 140 or even exceed 140. However, this is not yet known because the final counts of overdose deaths for 2018 and 2019 have not been released. The CDC has releasedprovisional data for 2018that indicates the number of drug overdose deaths dropped from 70,237 in 2017 to 68,110 in 2018. The CDC warns that this number is likely ""underreported due to incomplete data,"" but the overall drop suggests that opioid-related overdoses also decreased in 2018. This could mean the number of opioid overdose deaths is actually less than 130 per day. Aaron Williams, senior director for training and technical assistance for substance abuse at the National Council For Behavioral Health, explained there are a number of reasons why opioid overdose deaths constitute such a large portion of drug overdose deaths. ""Over the last decade and a half, there has been a significant increase in the prescription of and use of opioid-based medications for pain, in particular,"" Williams said. He said many people developed substance use problems due to this uptick, which increased overdose deaths because high doses of opioids can cause respiratory depression that leads to death. Williams also said in recent years illegal opioids have become easier to get, with heroin getting ""cheaper and purer"" as one example. He said potent synthetic opioids (tramadol, fentanyl, etc.) have moved into the pipeline as well. ""You have literally 140 people dying every day of opioid-related overdoses,"" Attorney General Eric Schmitt said at a public discussion about the opioid epidemic. The most recent data available from 2017 indicates that it’s actually about 130 people who die every day from overdoses involving opioids. Schmitt was off by only about 10 deaths.

It increases your chance of getting Covid, it increases your chance of spreading Covid and it damages your immune system to such a degree that you have a higher risk of hospitalisation and death."" These claims are false. Dr Hoffe says in the video that a study of healthcare workers in Cleveland, Ohio substantiates his comments, but it does not. Why these claims are wrong The video includes a chart from the Cleveland study which implies a correlation between past vaccine doses and Covid infection during the study period, but the study authors have warned that the explanation for these numbers is not clear , as reported by the fact checking site Logically. Even if the correlation is real, that also doesn't necessarily mean the doses caused people to have a higher chance of catching Covid. As we've written before , vaccinated people might be more likely to take Covid tests, or report Covid infections. Knowing they are more protected, they might even be more likely to risk catching the disease. Indeed a different chart from the same study, which compares those who received the bivalent vaccine with those who didn't, shows that people who received it were less likely to catch Covid, when the data was adjusted to account for some other differences between the groups . In fact, the study says its findings suggest that the bivalent vaccine was effective to some extent against two strains of Covid, although it did not demonstrate effectiveness against a third. Speaking to Full Fact via the Science Media Centre for our last check , Dr Lance Turtle, Reader and Honorary Consultant Physician in Infectious Diseases, Clinical Infection, Microbiology & Immunology at the University of Liverpool, told us that it was not plausible that more vaccine doses would lead to a higher chance of catching Covid. Dr Turtle said: ""There is no biological basis whatsoever for thinking that the vaccine could result in a state where you were more likely to become infected. To me it seems pretty obvious that [this apparent association] would either be down to exposure, or testing behaviour. ""People who get vaccinated are much more likely to be concerned about Covid and therefore more likely to get tested."" What we know about the vaccines Evidence from the UK Health Security Agency's vaccine surveillance report suggests that the Covid vaccines offer some limited protection against infection with more recent variants of the virus for a short period of time. Real world data on those aged 65 or older also shows that the vaccine had a substantial protective effect against hospitalisation with Covid, particularly in the months after vaccination. Data from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre in the UK also suggests that people who were not vaccinated were far more likely to be admitted to intensive care, compared with those who were. Mr Preddie does not comment audibly on the video of Dr Hoffe, and his reactions and the captions included with the video give no indication that Dr Hoffe's claims are false.

87,"[Claim]:An entire ship disappeared and traveled 40 years in the future during the Philadelphia experiment.[Evidences]:There is no evidence that the Philadelphia experiment actually happened or that a ship disappeared and traveled in the future. An Instagram account called ""aiasanworld,"" which has 160k followers, posted a photo on September 30. The photo features a ship and the text on the photo reads, ""Philadelphia experiment: It began as WW2 Navy Experiment to demagnetize military ships & make them Radar invisible. It ended with a ship completely disappear & time travelled 40 years in future."" This claim around the Philadelphia experiment is baseless. It has been circulating for years and has been debunked previously. The theory is so popular that two movies have been made on this, and several books have been written about it. Stories around the Philadelphia experiment usually have the same underlying claim about a ship disappearing and people on board traveling into the future. According to an article in the Guardian, the story of this military experiment is often referred to as Project Rainbow. The article states, ""As part of Project Rainbow, while docked at Philadelphia Navy Yard in 1943, the cannon-class destroyer USS Eldridge (DE 173) was fitted with a number of powerful generators and something called a 'time zero generator'. When this was switched on, the Eldridge was engulfed in a greenish haze, then, with the imprint of its hull still visible in the water, the ship disappeared from view for 20 minutes. Following the experiment, the Eldridge's crew appeared highly excitable, even ravingly insane. Those onboard claimed to have seen another port, Newport News in Virginia, 600 miles from Philadelphia. Had the ship been teleported there during the experiment? A second experiment took place a few weeks later, this time at sea accompanied by SS Andrew Furuseth. Once again, the Eldridge vanished but, when it reappeared, many of its crew were horribly burned, others had 'merged' with the structure of the ship. One vanished entirely."" The article debunks the story citing false details. It says, ""Of course, the story is hokum, created by eccentric UFO enthusiast Carl Allen in 1956."" According to an article in Military.com, Edward Dudgeon, who served in the U.S. Navy aboard the USS Engstrom, which was dry-docked in the Philadelphia Naval Yard where the Eldridge was, ""both ships did have classified devices on board. They were neither invisibility cloaks nor teleportation drives designed by aliens, but instead, they scrambled the magnetic signatures of ships using the degaussing technique, which provided protection from magnetic torpedoes aboard U-boats."" Furthermore, How Stuff Works suggested that ""the 'green glow' reported by witnesses that day could be explained by an electric storm or St. Elmo's Fire which, in addition to being an American coming-of-age film starring the Brat Pack, is a weather phenomenon in which plasma is created in a strong electric field, giving off a bright glow, almost like fire. Finally, inland canals connected Norfolk to Philadelphia, allowing a ship to travel between the two in a few hours."" Furthermore, a letter from the Office of Naval Research (ONR) was posted online in September 1996 by the U.S. military’s Washington Headquarters Services. The letter states that the ONR had received many queries about its possible role in Eldridge’s “disappearance."" The ONR says these suspicions may stem from real experiments in making a ship undetectable or ""invisible"" to magnetic mines. But not invisible to the human eye. The letter says that the ONR “has never conducted any investigations on invisibility, either in 1943 or at any other time."" The ONR also says that its scientists “do not believe that such an experiment could be possible except in the realm of science fiction.""",False,False
88,"[Claim]:A 2007 Harvard University study proved that areas with higher rates of gun ownership have lower crime rates.[Evidences]:Following the Umpqua Community College shooting in October 2015, an undated article on the web site BeliefNet titled “Harvard University Study Reveals Astonishing Link Between Firearms, Crime and Gun Control” attracted significant traction on social media. The article (split up across six pages) didn’t lead with the name of the study it referenced, and without ever once linking to the document on which it was based, it maintained: According to a study in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy, which cites the Centers for Disease Control, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and the United Nations International Study on Firearms Regulation, the more guns a nation has, the less criminal activity. In other words, more firearms, less crime, concludes the virtually unpublicized research report by attorney Don B. Kates and Dr. Gary Mauser. But the key is firearms in the hands of private citizens. “The study was overlooked when it first came out in 2007,” writes Michael Snyder, “but it was recently re-discovered and while the findings may not surprise some, the place where the study was undertaken is a bit surprising. The study came from the Harvard Journal of Law, that bastion of extreme, Ivy League liberalism. Titled Would Banning Firearms Reduce Murder and Suicide?, the report “found some surprising things.” While identifying details were curiously absent on the five pages that followed, it was clear the “study” in question was an item titled “Would Banning Firearms Reduce Murder and Suicide?” originally published in the Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy (Volume 30, Number 2) [PDF]. Of primary importance is the subsequent, widely misapplied label of the word “study” with reference to the 2007 item in question. The Harvard Journal of Law & Public Policy describes itself as “one of the most widely circulated student-edited law reviews and the nation’s leading forum for conservative and libertarian legal scholarship.” Papers published in that journal are (while perhaps competitively sourced) in no way equivalent to peer-reviewed research published in a credible science-related journals as “studies.” Use of the term “study” to refer that 2007 article dishonestly suggested that the assertions made by its authors were gathered and vetted under more rigorous study conditions, which didn’t appear to be the case. The paper was credited to authors Don B. Kates and Gary Mauser. A profile for Kates (a gun rights enthusiast [PDF]) describes him as “[one of the] foremost litigators, criminologists and scholars on the Second Amendment and the fundamental right to self-defense and the individual right to keep and bear arms in the country.” Kateswas prominently featured in a March 2013 Washington Post article about gun lobby efforts to infiltrate law review publications, and Mauser’sweb site biography reads: His interest in firearms and “gun control” grew out of his research in political marketing. He has published two books, Political Marketing, and Manipulating Public Opinion and more than 20 articles. For the past 15 years, Professor Mauser has conducted research on the politics of gun control, the effectiveness of gun control laws, and the use of firearms in self defense. In a document dated June 2009 [PDF], Director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center Dr. David Hemenway addressed the 2007 article’s flaws in correlating higher rates of gun ownership with lower crime rates thusly: The article appears in a publication, described as a “student law review for conservative and libertarian legal scholarship.” It does not appear to be a peer-reviewed journal, or one that is searching for truth as opposed to presenting a certain world view. The paper itself is not a scientific article, but a polemic, making the claim that gun availability does not affect homicide or suicide. It does this by ignoring most of the scientific literature, and by making too many incorrect and illogical claims. Incidentally, Hemenway is named as a researcher on a 2007 Social Science and Medicine study titled “State-Level Homicide Victimization Rates in the US in Relation to Survey Measures of Household Firearm Ownership, 2001–2003.” That research (carried out by researchers at the Harvard Injury Control Research Center) found: Analyses that controlled for several measures of resource deprivation, urbanization, aggravated assault, robbery, unemployment, and alcohol consumption found that states with higher rates of household firearm ownership had significantly higher homicide victimization rates for children, and for women and men. In these analyses, states within the highest quartile of firearm prevalence had firearm homicide rates 114% higher than states within the lowest quartile of firearm prevalence. Overall homicide rates were 60% higher. The association between firearm prevalence and homicide was driven by gun-related homicide rates; non-gun-related homicide rates were not significantly associated with rates of firearm ownership. Hemenway’s 2009 writing pointed to weak points in the 2007 paper, such as a highly misleading excerpt that misrepresented two then-recent public health and policy studies. Immediately following a citation of Kates’ own prior work (his 1979 book Restricting Handguns: The Liberal Skeptics Speak Out), the authors posited that two large government-backed studies had failed to conclude gun control measures affected crime rates: In this connection, two recent studies are pertinent. In 2004, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences released its evaluation from a review of 253 journal articles, 99 books, 43 government publications, and some original empirical research. It failed to identify any gun control that had reduced violent crime, suicide, or gun accidents. The same conclusion was reached in 2003 by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control’s review of then-extant studies.1 The first referenced item, Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review (2004), pointed to a lack of sufficient data with respect to gun policy (not a failure to conclude that gun control reduced crime): In summary, the committee concludes that existing research studies and data include a wealth of descriptive information on homicide, suicide, and firearms, but, because of the limitations of existing data and methods, do not credibly demonstrate a causal relationship between the ownership of firearms and the causes or prevention of criminal violence or suicide. The issue of substitution (of the means of committing homicide or suicide) has been almost entirely ignored in the literature. What sort of data and what sort of studies and improved models would be needed in order to advance understanding of the association between firearms and suicide? Although some knowledge may be gained from further ecological studies, the most important priority appears to the committee to be individual-level studies of the association between gun ownership and violence. Currently, no national surveys on ownership designed to examine the relationship exist. The committee recommends support of further individual-level studies of the link between firearms and both lethal and nonlethal suicidal behavior. Similarly, the actual wording of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)’s cited report more explicitly conflicted with the authors’ assertions that a conclusion had been drawn: The Task Force found insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combinations of laws reviewed on violent outcomes. (Note that insufficient evidence to determine effectiveness should not be interpreted as evidence of ineffectiveness.) This report briefly describes how the reviews were conducted, summarizes the Task Force findings, and provides information regarding needs for future research. In short, the purported 2007 Harvard “study” with “astonishing” findings was in fact a polemic paper penned by two well-known gun rights activists. Its findings were neither peer-reviewed nor subject to academic scrutiny of any sort prior to its appearance, and the publication that carried it was a self-identified ideology-based editorial outlet edited by Harvard students. The paper disingenuously misrepresented extant research to draw its conclusions, and researchers at Harvard (among which Kates and Mauser were not included) later objected to the paper’s being framed as a “study” from Harvard (rather than a law review paper). The paper wasn’t “virtually unpublicized research” (as BeliefNet claimed); rather, it was simply not deemed noteworthy at the time it was published due to the fact it was neither a study nor much more than a jointly-written editorial piece representing its authors’ unsupported opinions.",False,Conflicting
89,"[Claim]:""In the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined.""[Evidences]:Rhode Island has long been a battleground in the fight for open government. Public bodies vote in secret. Deals are cut behind closed doors. Police departments withhold arrest records and daily logs. A report issued last month by ACCESS/RI found a ""troubling level of non-compliance"" with the state's open records law and called for enhanced oversight by the Attorney General's office. During an interview with Rhode Island Public Radio that aired on Oct. 2, 2014, incumbent Atty. Gen. Peter Kilmartin, a Democrat, was asked about enforcement of the open records law. He lamented that some public bodies are not following the law despite repeated attempts to educate government officials about the documents that are supposed to be public. ""Unfortunately, in the past three years, we have prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined,"" he said. ""That tells me there is still a problem."" It's a statement he repeated on Oct. 10, 2014, during a taping of a debate on WPRI-TV with Republic Dawson Hodgson. We were interested in whether Kilmartin has brought more open records cases to court than his two predecessors, Patrick Lynch (now a lawyer in private practice) and Sheldon Whitehouse (now a U.S. Senator). When we asked Kilmartin's office for a tally of the cases, spokeswoman Amy Kempe sent us a list of 18 civil lawsuits dating as far back as 2002. ""There were no lawsuits from 1999 to 2002,"" she said in an email. According to the list, Whitehouse took one case to court, suing the Anthony fire district in 2002. During Lynch's eight years in office he filed seven suits -- against public entities in Johnston, North Kingstown, Cranston, Woonsocket and Lincoln. Barrington was sued twice. Since 2011, according to the list, Kilmartin has filed 10 suits against public entities for violating the open records law, starting with the Albion Fire District in Lincoln (which Lynch also sued) and ending most recently with the town of Warren. We spot-checked Kilmartin's cases using our archives. To check the list of his predecessors, we first contacted the offices of Lynch and Whitehouse to ask if Kilmartin was omitting any cases. Whitehouse's office said the number seems correct. Repeated inquiries to Lynch's law office produced no response. So we turned to court records and received a list of all civil suits brought by Whitehouse and Lynch against public bodies. Once again, Kilmartin's tally checked out. In summary, Peter Kilmartin said that in the past three years, his office has ""prosecuted or brought more cases on access to public records than in the previous 12 years combined."" His office has filed 10 suits since 2011. Lynch had seven during his eight years as Attorney General. Whitehouse had just one during his four years in that office. We can't say if the trend is due to previous attorneys general being less aggressive in prosecuting violations of the state's open government laws than Kilmartin, or if public bodies are getting more brazen in ignoring them. Certainly the latest ACCESS/RI report offers evidence that the phrase ""open government"" is -- for some of Rhode Island's ""public"" bodies -- an oxymoron. Rhode Island's culture of secrecy persists, but Kilmartin has filed more lawsuits than his two predecessors conbined so we rate Kilmartin's claim as True.

90,"[Claim]:Says the Trump administration has ""a scheme to try to take (Oleg Deripaska’s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45"" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions.[Evidences]:Senate Democrats are expected to force a vote to block the Trump administration from lifting sanctions on three companies connected to Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska. The sanctions relief requires the Russian billionaire, who has ties to President Vladimir Putin, to divest himself of large corporate ownership stakes, including a controlling interest in the world’s second largest aluminium production company, Rusal. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the Senate Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat, expressed skepticism about the administration's proposal during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to force a vote against the sanctions relief shortly. Warner said the Treasury Department has ""a scheme to try to take (Deripaska’s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45"" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions. But he doubted the arrangement would curb Deripaska’s influence. ""As more and more of this information comes out about ties between Trump and Trump officials and the Russians,"" Warner said, ""it is the worst time to signal that we're going to take the pressure off of oligarchs like Deripaska."" Warner’s partial description of the Treasury Department’s deal with Deripaska is right, but it leaves out important details. Furthermore, several experts we spoke to had a different read of the Trump’s administration’s reasons for wanting the sanctions lifted. We asked Warner's office for comment, but didn't hear back. Warner was right about some of the mechanics of the Treasury Department’s deal with Deripaska. Here’s the quick backstory on the sanctions. Last April, the Treasury Department placed sanctions on seven Russian oligarchs, including Oleg Deripaska, as well as a dozen companies the oligarchs either owned or controlled. The Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC — the Treasury Department’s sanctions arm — said in a report that ""the action aggressively targeted Russian oligarchs and elites that further the Kremlin's global malign activities."" The misbehavior included ""attempts to subvert Western democracy, support for the (Syrian President Bashar al-) Assad regime, malicious cyber activities, occupation of Crimea, and instigation of violence in Ukraine."" Among the dozen sanctioned companies were three that were connected to Deripaska, who the Treasury Department referred to as ""a Kremlin insider."" Deripaska held a 70 percent ownership stake in EN+, the holding company for the aluminum powerhouse Rusal, and energy company ESE. The department agreed to lift sanctions on the three companies in exchange for Deripaska’s ownership stake in EN+ dropping from 70 to 44.95 percent. Doing so clears a key threshold. With Deripaska no longer the majority owner, the company becomes eligible to have sanctions lifted under the Treasury Department’s ""50-percent rule,"" a process known as delisting. But the deal tacks on additional conditions that Warner didn’t mention. It includes a corporate restructuring, designed to limit Deripaska’s (and Kremlin) influence over the companies, plus additional reporting and transparency requirements. Unless lawmakers block it, the sanctions are due to be lifted very soon, by Jan. 18. While this would relieve some of the economic pain inflicted on Deripaska’s companies, it’s worth noting that the sanctions on Deripaska personally would remain in effect. ""Deripaska won't see a penny of the income from the shares until he himself is delisted — and that is not in the cards with this divestiture deal,"" said Samantha Sultoon, a visiting senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Most of the foreign policy experts we talked to — though not all — shared Warner’s skepticism that the corporate reshuffling plan would keep Deripaska in check. ""Given how business is done by influential, Kremlin-connected oligarchs in Russia, I have no question that if Deripaska wants to be in control, he will be,"" said Joseph DeThomas, a former high-ranking State Department official who teaches international affairs at Penn State University. Warner is among a group of Democrats who have raised questions about the Trump administration’s motives for granting sanctions relief to the Deripaska-linked companies, which they see as helping out a Putin crony. However, most experts we spoke to said this is a case of the Trump administration’s clumsiness, not coziness. Back in April, when the sanctions hit the aluminum giant Rusal, it sent shockwaves through the global aluminum markets. The price of aluminum soared over the following weeks. Europe, which relies heavily on Russia’s metals market, faced the prospect of plant closures and lost jobs. Even now, the European Union strongly supports the lifting of sanctions. The move also disrupted Rusal’s global supply chain. According to the Treasury Department, Rusal subsidiaries in the United States, Ireland, Sweden, Jamaica, Guinea, and elsewhere ""faced imminent closure,"" before the Treasury stepped in to mitigate some of the damage. According to experts, the Treasury discovered it had bitten off more than it could chew. ""They were done clumsily,"" Alina Polyakova, of the Brookings Institution, said of the sanctions. ""It seems clear that the administration did not plan for the dramatic effects on aluminum markets and the knock-on effects on European businesses."" Warner himself acknowledged this aspect, saying, ""I know there's concerns from our European allies about these sanctions."" That seems to undercut Senate Democrats’ suggestion that sanctions-relief is a sign of undue coziness between team Trump and Russian oligarchs. Still, in the midst of Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation into the Trump campaign’s ties to Moscow, the optics of the sanctions relief plan are not good. ""The Treasury was in a hopeless situation and does not want to state clearly that they made a mistake,"" said Anders Åslund, senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. ""Therefore they now look as if they are helping Deripaska."" Warner said the Trump administration has ""a scheme to try to take (Deripaska’s) ownership level down from 70 percent to roughly 40, 45"" so that the Russian company is no longer subject to sanctions. Warner’s description of the Treasury Department’s deal with Deripaska is partially right, but it leaves out important details. The plan also entails corporate restructuring, plus additional reporting and transparency measures. And the sanctions against Deripaska himself would remain in place. Most experts we spoke to said sanctions relief wasn’t a ""scheme"" so much as it was the Trump administration’s way of ending the disruption it inflicted on the global metals market when it sanctioned Deripaska’s aluminum company Rusal. In other words, it’s more likely a case of clumsiness, rather coziness with Russian oligarchs — as Senate Democrats suggest. We rate this Half True. ",Conflicting,Conflicting

92,"[Claim]:After a “major water main break,” Georgia election workers counted “18,000 ballots, all for Biden” that they pulled from suitcases and with no election observers present.[Evidences]:In an hour-long phone call pressuring Georgia’s secretary of state to overturn the results of the election, President Donald Trump rehashed the debunked claim that election workers in Atlanta were caught on tape secretly counting ""suitcases"" full of fraudulent ballots behind closed doors. State and county officials have said the surveillance video Trump mentioned shows normal ballot processing. But Trump stood by his inaccurate version of events during the Jan. 2 call, which was first reported by the Washington Post. ""That was the tape that’s been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else,"" Trump said to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, according to the recording. In Trump’s telling, the Nov. 3 tape showed that after a ""major water main break"" at Atlanta’s State Farm Arena, where Fulton County election workers were counting ballots, ""everybody fled the area."" With Republican election observers gone, the county’s election workers returned, Trump said. They reached under a table and pulled out ""suitcases or trunks"" full of ballots that were hidden there hours earlier, he said, and they secretly tallied ""18,000 ballots, all for (Joe) Biden."" Trump’s story aligns with the false narrative that Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and his team pushed when they introduced the tape during a Dec. 3 hearing with state legislators. What actually happened, according to Georgia and Fulton County officials, is much different. Gabriel Sterling, a Republican and Georgia’s voting system implementation manager, has addressed the ""suitcases"" claim in social media postings, TV interviews, and press conferences since Dec. 4, when he tweeted that the video showed ""normal ballot processing."" In a Jan. 4 press conference ahead of Georgia’s runoff Senate election, Sterling spent minutes rebutting Trump’s claim, which he called ""thoroughly debunked."" The sequence of events he described lined up with what PolitiFact and multiple other fact-checkers have reported. In reality, the ballots seen in the surveillance footage were not in suitcases or trunks. They were in ""normal absentee ballot carriers,"" Sterling said. The ballots were removed from their envelopes while news media personnel and observers were still in the room, and there was no formal announcement for observers to leave. But some observers took off once the election workers responsible for cutting the envelopes open and verifying the ballots inside had finished their job and started packing up for the night. Workers tasked with scanning the ballots got instructions to keep going, and an independent monitor and investigator oversaw the ballot counting as it continued into the night, Sterling said. In an affidavit, Frances Watson, the Georgia secretary of state’s chief investigator, wrote that the state’s ""investigation and review of the entire security footage revealed that there were no mystery ballots that were brought in from an unknown location and hidden under tables."" ""Around 10 p.m., with the room full of people, including official monitors and the media, video shows ballots that had already been opened but not counted placed in the boxes, sealed up, stored under the table,"" Watson wrote. ""When the counting continued into later in the night, those boxes were opened so that the ballots inside could then be counted."" Sterling said he reviewed the full tape with a local reporter. ""The president’s legal team had the entire tape, they watched the entire tape, and then from our point of view, intentionally misled the state Senate, voters and the people of the United States about this,"" Sterling said. There’s no evidence that the ballots counted on election night were ""all for Biden,"" as Trump claimed, and a state monitor disputed that 18,000 votes were tallied during that window. There’s also no connection between the ""suitcase"" allegation and a leak at State Farm Arena on Election Day. State Farm Arena reported that one room being used for ballot counting had been affected by a water leak at approximately 6 a.m., hours before the scene in question took place. Arena staff repaired the leak, which Sterling attributed to an overflowing urinal, in roughly two hours, according to the arena’s statement. No ballots were damaged, the arena said. The Trump campaign and White House did not immediately respond to our inquiries. Trump claimed a tape shows that after a ""major water main break"" in Georgia, election workers pulled out ballots stored in ""suitcases"" under a table and counted ""18,000 ballots, all for Biden"" with no election observers present. That’s wrong in multiple ways. State and county officials have repeatedly debunked this claim. The video in question does not show any wrongdoing, and there’s no evidence that the ballots shown were fraudulent or ""all for Biden."" The water leak, which was sourced to a urinal, was unrelated.

The video has been deceptively edited to suggest Gates admitted to making a profit off of vaccines. He was actually speaking about the economic benefits of global vaccination efforts.

A Facebook userrecently shareda YouTube video, titled “Bill Gates admits on CNBC TV he’s making 200 BILLION US$ on his Vaccinations,” that shows a 25-second clip from aJanuary 2019 interviewGates did with CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

In response to a question about the return on his foundation’s $10 billion investment in vaccines, Gates appears tosay, “Over a twenty-to-one return, so if you just looked at the economic benefits that’s a pretty strong number compared to anything else.”

“Take the numbers that you ran through for if you had put that money into an S&P 500 and reinvested the dividends, you come up with something like $17 billion, but you think it’s $200 billion,” CNBC’s Becky Quick then says to Gates in the video.

It abruptly ends after Gates responds, “Here, yeah.”

The Daily Caller reviewed theinterview in its entiretyand found the YouTube clip has been deceptively edited. Parts of the interview appear to have spliced together, removing key context surrounding Gates’ comments.At no pointdoes he claim to have made $200 billion in profits from his foundation’s vaccination efforts.

“It’s been $100 billion overall that the world’s put in, our foundation is a bit more than $10 billion, and we feel there’s been over a 20-to-one return,” Gates actually said. “So if you just look at the economic benefits that’s a pretty strong number compared to anything else. The human benefit in millions of lives saved.”

The $200 billion-figure Quick mentions actually comes from theCopenhagen Consensus Center, a think tank that analyses comparative strategies in fighting poverty. Gates used the Copenhagen Consensus Center’s estimate in aJanuary 2019 Wall Street Journal op-edto compare the impact of his foundation’s $10 billion investment to the hypothetical impact on developing countries had he instead invested in other sectors, such as energy or infrastructure.

“By investing in global health institutions, however, we exceed all those returns: The $10 billion that we gave to help provide vaccines, drugs, bed nets and other supplies in developing countries created an estimated $200 billion in social and economic benefits,” Gateswrote.",False,True

""They even voted to spend public public funds on their political campaigns; up to $5 million each for travel expenses, staffers, even TV ads. And Abigail Spanberger voted with them, not you."" The ad flashes grainy videos of three Democrats often targeted by conservatives: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Adam Schiff of California, and Rep.Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. It ends with videos of Spanberger. The narrator says, ""Washington Democrats and Abigail Spanbereger: They flood your TV with attack ads; you get stuck with the bills."" We fact checked whether Spanberger voted to give politicians up to $5 million for their campaigns. A similar claim against Spanberger was made last month in a TV ad by the conservative Congressional Leadership Fund. The charge is cropping up in ads against incumbent Democrats in races across the country. The ads target votes that Spanberger and other House Democrats cast on March 8, 2019 for the ""For the People Act of 2019,"" a 705-page bill that would expand voting rights, limit gerrymandering, strengthen ethics rules and reduce the influence of private donor money in politics. Spanberger was among 236 Democrats who cosponsored the measure. It passed the House on a starkly partisan 234-193 vote, with all participating Democrats supporting it, and all participating Republicans voting no. The bill has not been taken up in the GOP-controlled Senate. Campaign financing proposal The bill would provide a 6-to-1 match for small-dollar donations ($200 or less), and create a pilot program in three states to provide $25 vouchers for eligible voters to give to their favored candidates for Congress. Freitas’ ad gives the impression that everyone running for federal office would get public funding, but that’s not the case. Participation in the program would be optional. A candidate would have to agree not to accept any single contribution of more than $200, and any aggregate donations from an individual or PAC of more than $1,000. Each of those contributions, and voucher money, could receive the 6-to-1 match. To qualify for the program, a candidate would have to raise at least $50,000 in small-dollar donations from at least 1,000 individuals. Ray La Raja, professor of political science and an expert in campaign finance at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, has told PolitiFact that the eligibility requirements would make the matching program attractive to some candidates more than others. ""My hunch is that many Democrats would participate under the reform, but probably not those who expect highly competitive elections,"" he said. ""They would not want to risk coming up short of money for the campaign."" ""Additionally, candidates who have ideological followings will likely benefit from this program,"" he added. ""Ideological candidates tend to draw more small donors."" Freitas and other Republicans say the bill would allow up to $5 million in public financing for a candidate. The figure comes from a Bloomberg Government estimate in January 2019. Who pays for the funding? Freitas’ ad tells viewers ""you get stuck with the bill,"" suggesting the general public would pay for the matching funds. That’s not correct. The money actually would come from a new ""Freedom From Influence Fund"" under the U.S. Treasury, which would collect a 2.75 percent surcharge on criminal and civil fines and penalties or settlements with banks and corporations that commit corporate malfeasance. It should be noted, however, that the source of money for the matches was not specified in the version of the bill that Spanberger and other Democrats co-sponsored on Jan. 9, 2019. The fines against banks and corporations were added to the bill on March 5. The final bill seals off the possibility that individual and household taxpayers’ money would seep into the fund. It says if the Freedom From Influence Fund runs out of money, no money can be drawn from other sources. The bill allows payments for vouchers and grants to be reduced if the fund runs low. Our ruling Freitas’s ad says Spanberger and other Democrats ""voted to spend public funds on their political campaigns; up to $5 million..."" The claim refers to votes Spanberger and 233 of her Democratic House colleagues cast on March 8, 2019 for a bill that would provide a 6-to-1 match on small-dollar contributions to congressional candidates. Bloomberg News estimates candidates could receive as much as $5 million apiece in federal support. Although the bill would be a step towards public financing of congressional campaigns, Freitas glosses over some important details: Participation in the program would be optional, and against the interests of many Democratic and Republican candidates. To be eligible for the match, candidates would have to refuse aggregate contributions from any individual of more than $1,000. The program would not receive tax dollars paid by individuals and households. It would be funded by a 2.75 percent surcharge on civil and criminal fines paid by banks and corporations. Freitas’s statement tells half the story, and we rate it Half True. ",Conflicting,True
96,"[Claim]:A very well known supermarket in France reinstated cash payments after a protest involving 50 people against card-only payments.[Evidences]:A post shared more than 14,000 times on Facebook details a vague anecdote about a protest against a cashless policy at a ""very well known supermarket"" in France that led to the retailer reinstating cash. The same post has also been shared thousands of times on X (formerly known as Twitter). Despite this, there's no evidence that the protest recounted in the post ever took place. All businesses in France must accept cash by law, apart from in a few very limited circumstances such as if the notes are in a poor condition or the customer attempts to pay in a different currency. Claims surrounding cashless payments , a central banking system and digital currency are extremely popular on social media and we have fact checked them many times before. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in What does the post say? The post, which features a screenshot of a Facebook message or status, says: ""In France for three months now...Their approach to digital banking is simply fantastic. I'd like to share a bit about it. ""A very well known supermarket here decided to go cashless. ""A group of 50 people got together and agreed that they would all do a big shop on the same day. Pilling their trolleys to the brim and each person getting to the checkout - the human check out, not the machines - and having everything scanned before bringing cash out. ""The staff were absolutely overrun. There management in a complete tizz, everyone repeatedly, calmly and in a very organised and polite fashion acting as if they knew nothing. No edges, no rudeness, no humiliation. ""Offering No other method of payment than cash, willing to leave their trolleys behind if cash was not accepted... ""The supermarket reinstated cash."" The post later adds: ""They are doing it in every single area of France. Simply refusing to be part of it."" Businesses in France are obliged to take cash It is illegal not to accept cash in France —in shops but also in all other businesses, such as the petrol stations and restaurants which are referenced in another part of the same post. The law says : ""Refusing to accept banknotes and coins that have legal tender in France at the value at which they are in circulation is punishable by a fine applicable to class two offences."" Banknotes and coins can only be refused in very limited circumstances , such as if foreign currency is used, if the coins or notes are in poor condition, if the currency is detected as counterfeit and if the payment consists of more than 50 coins. Cash may also be refused for security or technical reasons, for example by a shopkeeper on a nightshift, or at parking meters to deter vandalism. Because of this, it's unlikely that a ""very well known supermarket"" in the country would decide to go totally cashless. No evidence any such protest has taken place Full Fact could find no information online about any protest like the one described in the Facebook post. While we were unable to find accounts that matched the social media protest, some large supermarket chains in the country have hit headlines in recent years after using a loophole in French law to keep stores open on Sunday afternoons. French labour laws state that employees of large supermarkets can't work past 1pm on Sunday. To avoid having to close the stores these supermarkets have sent cashiers home and kept self-scanning options only, an approach that has resulted in some protests from people who fear such a move could put jobs at risk. In 2022 Banque de France reminded two of France's biggest retailers that they were obliged to accept cash, after the introduction of self-scanning options (which do not accept banknotes or cards) only on Sundays meant that customers had to pay by card. Christophe Baud-Berthier, a director at Banque de France was quoted in French media saying : ""This is the principle and it must be remembered: a merchant cannot refuse a cash payment.""

Its Tagalog-language title translates as: “JUST IN: PULSE ASIA CONFIRMS VP LENI RECEIVED ‘ZERO’ VOTES IN MINDANAO / SEC. PANELO IS AMUSED!” The video shows presidential legal counsel Salvador Panelo discussing the results of a voter preference survey for the 2022 national elections. The survey results Panelo discusses bears the logo of research organisation Pulse Asia. Vice President Leni Robredo, who currently leads the political opposition in the Philippines, is among the potential 2022 candidates listed in the survey. Comments to the post indicate people believed the survey pertained to the results of the 2016 election. One wrote: ""This also confirms (Ferdinand Marcos Jr) is the real winner for the VP election in Mindanao. Supreme Court are you not bothered that you made a wrong decision?” The video circulated weeks after the Supreme Court ruled in Robredo’s favour and dismissed an election protest filed by her 2016 vice presidential race opponent Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Marcos Jr had accused Robredo of electoral fraud, but a recount in tightly contested areas gave her a bigger lead, AFP reported. An identical video was also shared alongside a similar claim on Facebook here and here; and in this blog post. However, the claim is misleading. Keyword searches on Google found the video corresponds to a longer video streamed live March 10, 2021 on the Facebook account of the Philippine presidential communications agency. The longer video shows Salvador Panelo presenting a Pulse Asia survey titled: “VOTER PREFERENCE FOR PRESIDENTIAL AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL TANDEMS FOR 2022.” He appears to mock Robredo for her survey performance in Mindanao island, where she is seen with a zero score. Nowhere in the video does Panelo mention that Pulse Asia confirmed Robredo received zero votes in Mindanao during the 2016 polls. Pulse Asia told AFP the survey is authentic, but denied it is about the 2016 elections as the misleading posts allege. In a phone interview on April 7, 2021, Pulse Asia chair Ronald Holmes said: “We don’t have anything in the survey that really would probe into what (the respondent’s) perception of the 2016 elections are.” “The survey is a commissioned survey. It was conducted this year.” Reports published in 2016 by media organisations Inquirer.net and GMA News Online also indicate Robredo did not get zero votes in Mindanao.",False,False

Those people included rock star Jon Bon Jovi. Our readers sent us a photograph of a man who looked like the singer scrubbing dishes in a restaurant kitchen. The rumor has been circulating as recently as October 2021 on Facebook. This was indeed the rock star himself. He posted the photograph in March 2020 to his personal Instagram account.

They ask patrons to donate to cover their meal and that of anyone who is in need. Before the pandemic struck, diners were also given the option to volunteer time and work for their meal. In the early days of the pandemic, the kitchen could only serve takeout, and found itself functioning without enough volunteers. So Bon Jovi himself stepped in to lend a hand. According to CNN, he helped out five days a week until July 2020 when restrictions eased.

100,"[Claim]:""Women in Florida make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes.""[Evidences]:Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Charlie Crist has started outlining what he wants to change about Florida, and he’s starting with how much women earn. ""Women in Florida make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes,"" Crist said in a campaign email sent out July 29, 2014, the same day he announced his First Day of Fairness plan. The plan outlines a series of executive orders Crist promised to make on his first day in office if he is elected. The potential orders promote causes like government transparency, raising the minimum wage among businesses contracted with the state, and, in this case, ending gender wage discrimination for employees of those contractors. PolitiFact has checked many claims about women making less than men, especially the past few years. Is Crist right about them making only 83 cents on the dollar in Florida, or is he short-changing voters? Time to check the paychecks. Measuring the gap The Crist campaign told us they took the figure from an April 2013 release by the National Partnership for Women & Families, a Washington-based a think tank focusing on women’s issues. The factsheet reads, ""In Florida, on average, a woman who holds a full-time job is paid $33,823 per year while a man who holds a full-time job is paid $40,951 per year. This means that women in Florida are paid 83 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to a yearly gap of $7,128 between men and women who work full time in the state."" Those numbers are from a larger report by the U.S. Census Bureau, the 2011 American Community Survey, which estimated median annual earnings for men and women who worked full-time, year-round over the prior 12 months. It’s worth noting right now that this data has already been revised. An April 2014 release from the same think tank updated the numbers from the 2012 Census survey estimates that Floridian women are making 84 cents on the dollar. That’s not what we’d consider a huge increase, but it still is a discrepancy compared to Crist’s claim. (His campaign didn’t tell us why they used the lower number.) But the Census Bureau isn’t the only federal agency that tracks income data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics measures in terms of weekly wages, not yearly. Unlike the Census Bureau, this method does not account for people who are self-employed, but it does include some people not measured in the Census Bureau’s annual figures, like some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers. These BLS numbers show that Florida women who worked full time in wage and salary jobs had median usual weekly earnings of $668 in 2011, which was 84 percent of men’s median weekly earnings. That edged up slightly to 85 percent in 2012. Nationally, the comparable figures from 2012 show a similar pattern: Census shows the gap at about 77 cents, while BLS says women make 82 percent of what men make. Both evaluations say Floridian men and women make less than the national median income, although the gender wage gap is marginally smaller. Why is that? There are several reasons, and none of them are flattering for Florida. Alayne Unterberger, associate research director at Florida International University’s Research Institute on Social and Economic Policy, said there’s a high level of working, single mothers in Florida, and they tend to have less education and fewer quality job opportunities. The National Women’s Law Center says almost 66 percent of Florida women make $10.10 an hour or less, and that while men only need a high school degree to move out of low-wage earning status, women usually require at least a bachelor’s degree. The slightly better wage gap is only because men in Florida are likelier to earn less than the national average at a greater rate than the state's women are, shrinking the difference. ""Historically in Florida both male and female wages have been depressed,"" Unterberger said. She pointed out that a study FIU published in 2014 found that the wage gap has only decreased about 1.8 percent since 1990. ""We haven’t done a very good job of narrowing that gap over the years."" Using 2013 mean wages (not median), the FIU study adjusted for age, education level and occupation. It found that overall, women in Florida make about 82 cents on the dollar compared to men. Caveats apply to what all these evaluations actually show. Gender wage gaps nationally are different from occupation to occupation, as the Institute for Women’s Policy Research showed in its report on the top 20 occupations for women for 2011. While the gap was lesser in fields like nursing (96 cents to every dollar) and cashiering (90 cents), it was higher in accounting (77 cents) and financial advising (66 cents). While discrimination is partly to blame, another factor is that men and women historically enter different occupational fields at different rates, a trend known as ""occupational segregation."" The Institute showed that women more often choose to be receptionists, nurses and teachers, for example, while men pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and software engineers. That means overall, women are more often employed in lower-paying fields than are men. Women also disproportionately earn college degrees that lead to lower-paying jobs than men, and take more time off work for pregnancy and child care, according to a 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh. That trend, though lessened by increased male involvement in child rearing, often restricts women’s career options and hours worked. Our ruling Crist said, ""Women in Florida make 83 cents for every dollar a man makes."" The figure came from a think tank using 2011 Census annual median wage data, and was bumped up a penny to 84 cents for 2012 in its latest statement on the issue. While there are other ways to evaluate the difference between what each gender earns, with several reasons why that’s the case, the Census numbers are one widely accepted measure.

101,"[Claim]:No, 2014 video does not show children who were forced to kill and eat babies by a satanic cult[Evidences]:IN SHORT: A video of children making claims of satanic cult abuses has resurfaced, nearly a decade after it first appeared. But a court ruling and several fact-checking organisations have debunked these claims, finding that the children were pressured into making the accusations by their mother and her partner. A video circulating on Facebook and other social media platforms shows two young children describing disturbing acts that they were subjected to or forced to commit. Among other things, the children describe being sexually assaulted and forced to kill and eat babies. This video was shared in May 2023, which was when Africa Check was alerted to it via WhatsApp, along with claims of a satanic cult abusing children. Yet none of this is true. The video was filmed in 2014, and while the story behind it is still upsetting, there is no truth to the claims the children are making. Children abused and forced to lie to authorities by mother and her partner The children in the video were never involved in any kind of satanic cult, were not abused by school teachers or members of their local church, and were not forced to kill or eat babies. Instead, an investigation by British police and social services discovered that the children had been abused by their mother, Ella Draper, and her partner, Abraham Christie. Draper and Christie forced the children to make false statements to police and authorities about ritual abuse . The investigation began in September 2014 shortly after claims of abuse were reported to the police by Christie's brother-in-law. Police searched the places where cult activities had supposedly taken place and the children were interviewed by police and examined by a paediatrician and child psychiatrist. A March 2015 judgement found that: ""The children's false stories came about as the result of relentless emotional and psychological pressure as well as significant physical abuse."" The judge wrote that ""torture is the most accurate way to describe what was done by Mr Christie in collaboration with Ms Draper"". The hearing also found : ""There was no satanic or other cult at which babies were murdered and children were sexually abused."" Christie and Draper had accused the children's father and school teachers, among others, of taking part in the abuse. But this was not true. Details reported on extensively, false claims already debunked One of the most unusual aspects of this claim is that the facts of the case have been known for some years and widely reported. Local and international news organisations reported the outcome of the March 2015 judgement at the time. The judgement itself is extremely clear. And fact-checking organisations have debunked the claims when they have been repeated in the years since. Hoaxed , a 2022 podcast presented by journalist Alexi Mostrous , re-told the story and conducted new interviews. Mostrous noted that, since the original claims were made, conspiracy theories about satanic cults abusing children have become more popular. The Pizzagate and QAnon conspiracy theories, both of which have been repeatedly disproven , revolve around similar claims. Fact-checkers have also reported this. When fact-checking organisation Lead Stories investigated an old video of the children in 2020, it noted that it was tagged with #Pizzagate and other hashtags commonly used by conspiracy theorists such as #SaveTheChildren , a hashtag hijacked by QAnon conspiracy theorists. There is no evidence for the disturbing acts described by the children in this video.",False,True

103,"[Claim]: meat and dairy products will be banned by 2030. Issue #46[Evidences]:Ukrainians are being intimidated with the claim that meat consumption will be banned by 2030, forcing everyone to become vegans. Conspiracy theorists suggest that this is happening at the behest of the World Economic Forum (WEF). In this way, the organization is said to be implementing its “Great Reset” program.

With the support of the USAID Health Reform Support project, VoxCheck analyzes and refutes public health narratives spread in the information space of Ukraine, Belarus, and russia on a weekly basis.

An article from Infowars is being circulated online about a 2019 document that recommends banning meat and dairy consumption by 2030, limiting individuals to three new clothing items per year, and one flight every three years. This supposedly suggests that the WEF wants everyone to become vegan and “wear uniforms” as part of the “Great Reset” program.

What’s the reality?

The resource Media Bias / Fact Check (used by independent fact-checkers within the IFCN network) rates the publications of InfoWars as conspiratorial and pseudoscientific. This media outlet largely disseminates unverified and pseudoscientific claims.

The document exists; however, it does not impose any bans nor does it recommend any. It is an analytical report titled “The Future of Urban Consumption in a 1.5°C World.” It is not an action plan for cities to follow, but an analysis of possible options to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The report explores how cities can reduce consumption-related emissions to avoid a climate crisis. It focuses on six sectors: food, construction, clothing, transportation, aviation, and electronics. The report examines ways in which leaders, businesses, and the public can take action to change consumption habits and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The authors calculated that transitioning to a plant-based diet and reducing food waste could decrease emissions by up to 36% by 2030. Additionally, if consumers were to buy only three new items of clothing per year, emissions could be reduced by 39%. It’s important to note that the report discusses hypothetical scenarios and does not propose any actual implementation of such restrictions. The report also mentions that reducing red meat consumption and increasing the intake of vegetables and fruits in diets could annually prevent 160,000 deaths related to cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.

The report was prepared by the international community of mayors known as “C40 Cities” in partnership with the architectural firm “Arup Group” and the University of Leeds. This initiative was not driven by the World Economic Forum (WEF). Furthermore, the report was published in 2019, prior to the creation of the WEF’s “Great Reset” initiative, which was presented in 2020 as a proposed response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The “Great Reset” is a WEF initiative aimed at addressing key issues in modern capitalism, including sluggish economic growth, rising debt levels, poverty and unemployment, climate change, and increasing inequality, which can lead to political instability.

Mark Watts, the Executive Director of “C40 Cities,” described the aim of the research as follows: “This research clearly demonstrates that changing the way we consume could make a significant contribution to cutting emissions. This is a wake-up call for all leaders, business, and citizens to consider both the local and global climate impact of the things they consume, and an opportunity to better engage citizens and businesses in solving the climate emergency.” In essence, the report shows that consumption infrastructure has an impact on the climate, and therefore governments should take this into account when developing strategies. However, how to proceed is a decision made independently by each country.

The World Health Organization (WHO) does not prohibit the consumption of animal products. According to WHO recommendations, a healthy adult diet includes meat, meat products, and dairy products (with an emphasis on lean options). On July 10, 2023, the WHO team published a study on red and processed meat in the context of health and the environment. Experts acknowledge that reducing the consumption of processed and red meat is beneficial for human health. However, red meat itself can be an important component of a healthy diet, especially at certain stages of life.

""A study by the National Economics Research Association showed that the deal could cost 2.7 million lost jobs in the U.S. by 2025 should our country adhere to the commitments made by the Obama Administration,"" Bilirakis said. A reader who received the letter asked us to look into it. Would the United States have lost 2.7 million jobs had it remained in the agreement?

But when we asked NERA about it, the organization forwarded the same statement they put out following Trump’s speech.

""Selective use of results from a single implementation scenario and a single year compounds the mischaracterization."" Here’s why plucking the 2.7 million-lost jobs talking point is a bad idea. The study predicts the potential impact of hypothetical U.S. regulatory action to meet the carbon emission goals pledged in Paris. It was produced in March 2017 and funded by the American Council for Capital Formation and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, both vocal opponents of the agreement. The loss of 2.7 million jobs economy-wide by 2025 reported in the study is contingent on ""additional regulatory actions necessary to meet the Paris target."" But the Paris agreement does not require actions, as it was not binding, and the regulatory action mentioned has not been proposed. The study begins, then, with the assumption that regulation would expand beyond the electricity sector, which is where the Obama administration directed it. According to law professor Cary Coglianese, the director of the University of Pennsylvania Program on Regulation and author of Does Regulation Kill Jobs?, the study is a forecast based on an erroneous model. ""How accurate that forecast or any forecast will be depends upon how well the model matches reality and the world. The particular model used in that NERA analysis doesn’t match up with what I think most people would recognize as the reality of the economy,"" Coglianese said. According to Gary Yohe, a professor of economics and environmental studies at Wesleyan University who worked on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that received a share of the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, the model does not accurately reflect government regulation or the energy industry’s reaction to market trends. ""They impose what they interpret as the effect of what the Unites States agreed to under the Paris accord,"" Yohe said, but ""they pick the least efficient way of doing it."" The hypothetical regulations they impose are inflexible, ruling out cap-and-trade or taxes and instead set strict regulations on specific sectors. The NERA researchers acknowledged the risk of their predictions. ""The findings contained in this report may contain projections based on current data and historical trends,"" the report states. ""Actual results could be impacted by future events that cannot be predicted or controlled, including, without limitation, changes in business strategies, the development of future products and services, changes in market and industry conditions, the outcome of contingencies, changes in management, and changes in law or regulations."" The development of future products and services, though, is precisely what the renewable energy industry is all about. But the study assumes the economy and technology will remain unchanged. ""There’s no inclusion in the analysis of the growth or development of renewable energy sources, for example,"" Coglianese said. ""And one thing we know about jobs, renewable energy sources tend to result in hiring of more people and more jobs than in other parts of the energy sector."" ""According to the U.S.Energy and Employment Report designed by the Energy Information Administration, over 373,000 Americans were employed in solar energy, while the coal industry employed about 160,000 and continued to shrink since 2012 due, in part, to competition by natural gas. So while the quote in the NERA study seems to conflate job loss with unemployment, it ignores the possibility of a changing job market in which jobs in the renewable energy industry replace jobs in the traditional fossil fuel industry that would face heavier regulation to comply with the agreement. Our ruling Bilirakis said that the Paris accord could cost the United States 2.7 million jobs by 2025, citing a NERA study that presented this projection. But the study is unreliable, using an extrememodel that does not consider the possible benefits of carbon regulation and rules out investment, flexibility or technology that would lead to more jobs. And as NERA itself stated, the study was not designed as a cost-benefit analysis of the Paris accord. We rate this statement False.",False,Conflicting

106,"[Claim]:""Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled state legislature have added over $140 million in new special interest spending""[Evidences]:With his first ""state of the state"" address the night of Feb. 1, 2011, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker likely will tout some of his early legislative victories.Among them: Three tax breaks worth an estimated $140 million.But one of Walker’s political antagonists, Madison-based One Wisconsin Now, has slammed the three bills. In a Jan. 28, 2011, news release, the liberal advocacy group said:""Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled state legislature have added over $140 million in new special interest spending.""So, which is it? Tax cuts or spending?We know that state government folks are pretty crafty. But is it really possible for them to spend money they’ve decided not to tax in the first place?One Wisconsin Now’s statement cites three of the measures taken up by lawmakers since Walker called them into special session just hours after being inaugurated on Jan. 3, 2011.Here’s a look at each of the bills and their financial impact as estimated by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the Legislature’s non-partisan research agency.Economic development tax creditSigned into law Jan. 31, 2011, this bill increases the state’s economic development tax credit fund to $98.1 million, up from $73.1 million. The fund provides a tax credit for job creation, capital investment or related activity. The additional $25 million in credits is not expected to be claimed during the 2011-2013 biennium.So, if employers create new jobs and claim the credits, they would pay less in taxes to the state. No spending would be involved.Health Savings Account deductionAlso signed into law, this measure allows people to deduct contributions they make to Health Savings Accounts from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes. Nearly every other state already allows this.The deductions will reduce state revenue by an estimated $20.7 million in 2011-2012 and $27.3 million in 2012-2013.Tax deduction for creating jobsUnder this bill, which is awaiting Walker’s signature, employers would receive a tax deduction for each job they create. They would pay an estimated $33.5 million less per year in income and franchise taxes. In other words, the bill doesn’t result in any spending, but the state would take in less tax money.See a pattern here?The bills in question don’t create any expenditures -- those are done in budget bills, which Walker has yet to introduce. But they do mean the state will take in less money.One Wisconsin Now says they apply to ""special interests."" They may be targeted for specific purposes, but they also hit a wide range of people, including small business owners and any working person who has an HSA.We asked Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now’s executive director, how his organization could say the state would be spending $140 million when the effect of the three bills would be that the state would have $140 million less to spend.His reply: ""When money would otherwise be in the treasury which is no longer going to be there as a result of legislative action, that is the definition of spending.""Actually, it’s just the Legislature making the treasury smaller. But we decided to ask the question again.Ross: ""If no action had been taken, this money would have been in the treasury. It will now no longer be in the treasury. We feel that is a form of spending.""Hmmm.Ross is no dummy. He has a B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and an M.A. from George Washington University, according to a political bio. He’s worked for a number of Democratic politicos, including Wisconsin congressman Ron Kind. He even worked as a journalist.And Ross isn’t alone with his spending notion.David Riemer, who was budget director under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, said the concept of a ""tax expenditure"" dates back some 50 years to Stanley Surrey, an assistant U.S. treasury secretary. The idea, Riemer said, is that tax breaks with a particular purpose that could be accomplished by direct spending should be considered expenditures.""Their way of viewing this,"" Riemer said of One Wisconsin Now, ""is a legitimate, honestly grounded approach. But there’s also legitimate arguments on the other side.""OK, let’s go to the other side.George Lightbourn, who was secretary of administration under two Republican Wisconsin governors, said that what One Wisconsin Now is claiming is ""ridiculous"" -- ""there’s nothing being spent, there’s not an appropriation being made.""""From a political standpoint, I could see where you’d make that argument,"" Lightbourn said, referring to One Wisconsin Now. ""But it wouldn’t hold water with the accountants.""Or with the average taxpayer.We decided to try Ross a third time. This time, he tried to make his case by pointing out that Walker had described the federal stimulus bill as spending, even though the bill included tax cuts.Tax cuts and credits did make up about one-third of the $862 billion stimulus-- but two-thirds was spending.Three strikes is enough.One Wisconsin Now called $140 million in state tax breaks ""spending."" It’s estimated that the three bills in question would bring in $140 million less to state coffers. But that’s not spending. You can’t spend what you don’t have.We rate the statement Pants on Fire. Update: The day this PolitiFact item, One Wisconsin Now executive director Scot Ross modified the way he described the three tax break bills. Rather than calling them spending, he said in a news release issued by the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin that the bills are ""deficit-hiking corporate giveaways.""",False,Conflicting
107,"[Claim]:The Trump administration is refusing to fund emergency preparations for a coronavirus pandemic until the Democratic Member of Parliaments agrees to transfer $37 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program.[Evidences]:Trump officials have not objected raising funds for preparedness of coronavirus until Democrat MPs agree to transfer $37 million from the LIHEAP. The Trump administration will pay for the coronavirus response in part by cutting funds from health programs, including one that pays for heating and cooling assistance for the poor. According to a notice sent by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to Congress obtained by The Hill, Trump administration has proposed $37 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP). The press release from the official website of Ed Markey states in a letter dated 27 February 2020, to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) that Elizabeth Warren had made a new proposal for emergency funds to prepare the United States for a possible widespread outbreak of coronavirus as an instead for transferring money from Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program which is in underfunded. In a letter to congressional appropriators, Joe Kennedy III, Chellie Pingree, and Peter Welch showed their views against the proposal made by Trump administration’s emergency preparations to control coronavirus through removing the funding of $37 million from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. All the above statements made by Democrat MPs depicts that they are against the proposal of Trump administration. To pass a proposal, it is a requirement to get a majority in the House of Representatives, which proves that the proposal is unapproved. Meanwhile, there is no statement made by Republicans or government officials that they refusing to fund emergency preparations for coronavirus pandemic until Democrats MP's agree to cut home heating and cooling assistance for the poor by $37 million.

108,"[Claim]:In 2021, a petition to rename Reagan National Airport after dancer and TikTok personality Jojo Siwa garnered tens of thousands of signatures.[Evidences]:In the spring of 2021, several news outlets reported that a petition to rename Reagan National Airport in Washington, D.C., had gained tens of thousands of signatures, and that the proposal called for the airport to instead be named in honor of Jojo Siwa, a singer, dancer, actor, and YouTube personality. For example, on May 31, the website Uniladpublished an article with the headline “Petition to Rename Ronald Reagan Airport After Jojo Siwa Surpasses 70,000 Signatures.” Similar articles were published by Bustle and Insider. Those reports were accurate. The petition, launched on Change.org by Dylan Long in April 2021, made the following request: “Rename Ronald Reagan Airport to Jojo Siwa Washington National Airport.” As of June 1, it had more than 72,000 signatures. Long’s own description of the petition suggested that he was criticizing Reagan’s foreign policy record as president: “Why on earth is there an airport named after this war criminal?” Others who signed on to the proposal provided a variety of reasons for their support. Originally from Omaha, Nebraska, Joelle “Jojo” Siwa first came to prominence as a participant in the Lifetime reality television shows “Abby’s Ultimate Dance Competition” and “Dance Moms,” between 2013 and 2015. She has cultivated an enormous following on the video-sharing app TikTok and on YouTube. In January 2021, when she was 17 years old, Siwa came out as gay.

109,"[Claim]:""Nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through (the Women’s Health Program) do so at a Planned Parenthood health center.""[Evidences]:Speaking out against the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from a Texas family planning program for low-income women, five Democratic legislators aired a statistic indicating that the group is a crucial provider. ""Nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through this program do so at a Planned Parenthood health center,"" said a commentary in the March 6, 2012, Austin American-Statesman by Austin state Reps. Elliott Naishtat, Dawnna Dukes, Eddie Rodriguez, Mark Strama and Donna Howard. We looked into that figure amid debate over the state’s decision, which led the Obama administration to set in motion a phased-in cutoff of about $30 million in annual federal funds for the Texas Medicaid Women’s Health Program, which has served tens of thousands of women a year since its launch in 2007. To participate in the program, providers may not perform elective abortions. Since the program’s start, dozens of Planned Parenthood health centers in Texas have qualified because they don’t provide abortions and are legally separated from Planned Parenthood clinics that do. That is changing, however. The Texas health and human services commissioner signed a rule in February 2012 barring entities affiliated with abortion providers from the program, which had the effect of disqualifying Planned Parenthood health centers that do not provide abortions. In response, the Obama administration declined to renew the program, arguing that Texas’ new rule violates federal law by restricting women’s abilities to choose their own caregivers. Perry has pledged to continue the program with state money — and without Planned Parenthood. Under the program, participating women may receive health screenings, including a Pap smear, during the one family planning exam per fiscal year that the program covers. Examples of other screenings, related to family planning, that women can get during their visit: breast exam, pregnancy test, routine urinalysis, as well as testing for diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and high blood pressure. Screenings are not covered outside of the annual exam. The program also pays for birth control such as pills and condoms. Naishtat aide Nancy Walker told us by email that the ""nearly 45 percent"" figure came from ""multiple sources,"" including the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. She said the agency told her that in fiscal 2010, about 46 percent of clients in the state’s Women’s Health Program had received services from Planned Parenthood — which, we noticed, is a wider description than the legislators’ reference solely to ""health screenings."" Commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us that the state has not compiled data on where women in the program receive health screenings. Asked about the figure that Naishtat’s aide cited from the commission, Goodman told us that the figure is based on a data analysis for fiscal 2010 — Sept. 1, 2009, through Aug. 31, 2010 — showing that of the 106,711 women who were served by the program, 49,162 received a service from a Planned Parenthood clinic. That’s 46.1 percent. We wondered, though, if it’s correct to assume that all women in the program received health screenings, as the Democrats’ article suggests. Goodman speculated that it might be, pointing out that all women in the program are entitled to an annual exam with health screenings. Also, the Democrats’ article leaves the impression that the referenced women solely depended on Planned Parenthood clinics for their screenings. That might not be so. According to the commission’s figures, 27,256 of the 49,162 Women’s Health Program clients who were served by Planned Parenthood in fiscal 2010 also received a Women’s Health Program service from a provider not linked to Planned Parenthood. In a previous fact-check, we laid out a couple of possible explanations for those women being served by both Planned Parenthood and another type of provider. For one, some portion of the 27,256 women may have had their exams and screenings at a Planned Parenthood clinic and then any tests processed at an outside lab. In those cases — and the state couldn’t tell us how many of them there were — the only ""services"" that a woman would have received from a non-Planned Parenthood provider was lab testing. These women would not affect the Democrats’ statistic, since they received their screenings at Planned Parenthood. But under the program, it’s also possible for women to switch providers during the year and receive another exam and screenings. So some portion of the 27,256 women may have received screenings from both a Planned Parenthood and a non-Planned Parenthood provider during fiscal 2010. And if the number were large enough, the percentage of women in the program who received their screenings exclusively from a Planned Parenthood clinic would be smaller than 46 percent. Goodman told us the state has not teased out the detailed data that would settle this issue. Our ruling The Democratic legislators wrote that nearly 45 percent of women who received health screenings through the targeted family-planning program in fiscal 2010 had them at Planned Parenthood clinics. That could be so, but we identified a couple of unsettled hitches. According to the state, 46 percent of the cited program’s clients went to a Planned Parenthood clinic, but the state has no breakdown of the number of women who were screened overall, which is what the Democrats focused on. Also, the Democrats’ statement implies that 46 percent of women rely on Planned Parenthood exclusively for screenings, but some women included in the 46 percent could have had screenings at a different kind of clinic, though (again) such details are not available.

110,"[Claim]:""For the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world.""[Evidences]:President Barack Obama this week touted the progress his administration has made in recovering from the economic recession, focusing on developments in engineering and manufacturing. ""Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people, the good news is the economy is growing stronger,"" he said in a speech on Jan. 15, 2014, at North Carolina State University. ""Our businesses have now created more than 8 million new jobs since we hit bottom. Because of an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world."" PolitiFact wanted to know if Obama’s claim gives us an accurate picture of U.S. oil numbers. A spokesman offered up this White House blog post that touches on Obama’s point in more detail. Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995. We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to theirNovember 2013 report, the United Statesproducedan average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October andimported7.5 million barrels of oil per day. So Obama’s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point? Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports. ""Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,""Medlock said. The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It’s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there’s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn’t need to import as much oil supply. Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University. Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing. We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines. But we can’t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades. Still, it’s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country’s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration’s fuel efficiency standards. Our ruling Obama said the United States is producing more oil domestically than it’s importing from the rest of the world for the first time in nearly two decades. That claim is on the money. However, a lot of this has been in the works for awhile, including dynamics that pre-date the Obama administration. Experts told us the new dynamic is due to factors like the recession, increased fuel efficiency and ramped up domestic oil production. As a simple statement on where we stand on oil exports vs. imports, though, Obama’s claim is accurate. We rate it True.",True,True

The real-life baby shark! Mutant fish is born with 'a human face' https://t.co/H6gVZ3ZkLs — Daily Mail Online (@MailOnline) February 23, 2021 Coverage of the photograph was first reported on Feb. 23 by Indian publication Viva, which noted that a fisherman by the name of Abdullah Nuren captured the supposed mother of the deformed shark baby in his trawl net while fishing off the coast of Indonesia on Feb. 20. “The next day I split the belly of the mother shark and found three cubs in its stomach. Two like the mother, this one looks like a human face,” Abdullah reportedly told the publication. Snopes contacted Viva for further details about the species of the mother shark, and reached out to Abdullah, but did not hear back by the time of publication. A video of the shark was published by Newsflare, an aggregator of viral content that pays its contributors for providing user-generated stories. The publication did not appear to have independently vetted the video for authenticity. Malformations of shark species are not entirely unheard of. In 2011, a fisherman in the Gulf of California caught a pregnant dusky shark and when he cut open the catch, found a one-eyed albino shark fetus measuring 22-inches-long, reported National Geographic at the time. Snopes also spoke with Luiz Rocha, curator of fishes at the California Academy of Sciences, who cited two studies that confirmed it is possible for such a shark to exhibit deformities seen in the “human-faced” shark. One such condition that Rocha said could be responsible for the condition is synophthalmia, or partial cyclopia, which he believes to be real and exhibited in the photograph. “Scientists have been aware of these conditions for quite some time, what is different now is that photos that show it clearly are becoming viral because of the reach of social media. Not something all that rare though,” said Rocha. Taylor Chapple, assistant professor of the Oregon State University Department of Fisheries and Wildlife, told Snopes that the video did not show enough of the shark to allow for a species verification or to determine whether the photograph itself was legitimate. And while it’s entirely possible that the fetal shark in question had experienced a deformation, it cannot be verified with certainty. “Just like any living thing, sharks can have malformations and mutations in their genetic code that are presented during development,” said Chapple. “Obviously in the wild most of these are not viable, which I’m guessing would have been the case with this animal, so we never see them unless they are caught in utero.” Identifying the shark is difficult without a dorsal view and further demographic information, including characteristics of the supposed mother. Indonesia’s Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries reported in 2020 that there are at least 117 species of sharks and rays found in the waters surrounding the southeastern Asian nation. Sharks reproduce through three main methods, according to the nonprofit conservation organization Shark Trust. Some sharks are known to lay eggs in what is known as oviparity, while others reproduce through ovoviparity, which is when the female carries the eggs inside of her. Once developed, ovoviparious eggs will hatch inside of the mother, who will then give birth to the young. Other sharks will give live birth through what is called viviparity. This is the most advanced form of reproduction and allows for the baby shark to develop within its mother’s body before being birthed. So, while it is entirely possible that this photograph accurately depicts an unborn shark cut from its mother’s womb, Snopes was not able to independently verify its authenticity, and as such, we rate this claim as “Unproven.”",False,Conflicting
112,"[Claim]:Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) introduced in Nov 2015. Around 4 crore doses administered to children.[Evidences]:The BJP government has published an infographic on the 48-months portal that makes four claims about vaccination. This article is a fact check of the claims. The BJP government has published an infographic on the 48-months portal that makes four claims about vaccination. This article is a fact check of the claims. About the Government’s Immunization Program Immunization Program in India was introduced in 1978 as ‘Expanded Program of Immunization’ (EPI) by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. In 1985, the program was modified as ‘Universal Immunization Program’ (UIP) to be implemented in phased manner to cover all districts in the country by 1989-90 with the one of largest health programs in the world. Despite being operational for many years, UIP has been able to fully immunize only 65% children in the first year of their life. Hence successive governments have taken up multiple immunization programs, both to align with global programs and also to fight newer threats. How many doses of IPV were administered? The first claim is that ‘inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) introduced in Nov 2015. Around 4 crore doses administered to children’. The annual report (2017-18) of the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW) states that ‘there are three types of Polio viruses namely type-1, 2 and 3 for which the vaccine was provided under Universal Immunization Programme as trivalent oral polio vaccine. Since last case of wild polio virus type-2 was reported in 1999, therefore, Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has recommended switch from trivalent OPV to bivalent OPV (containing only type-1 & 3). The tOPV to bOPV switch happened in India on 25th April, 2016. As part of Global Polio end-game strategy, to mitigate the risk associated with tOPV to bOPV switch, MoHFW has introduced Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) in UIP in November, 2015, which was expanded across the country by June, 2016. Currently, two dose fractional schedule is being followed in the country with vaccination at 6 weeks and 14 weeks of age. Till December, 2017, around 3.45 crore doses of IPV have been administered to children across the country since its introduction’. As per provisional reports, till June 2017, a total of 4.56 crore doses of IPV have been supplied to the States/UTs. The IPV vaccine is provided to state Government by Government of India under Universal Immunization Programme. The IPV vaccination is mainly carried out by the government hospitals and other service delivery outlets under government. It is evident from this information that while more than 4 crore doses were supplied to the state governments, slightly more than 3.4 crore doses were administered till December 2017. Since polio vaccinations are given in two doses, the number of children immunized is half the number of doses administered. Claim: Inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) introduced in Nov 2015. Around 4 crore doses administered to children. Fact: MoHFW has introduced Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) in UIP in November, 2015, which was expanded across the country by June, 2016. 4.56 crore doses of IPV have been supplied to the state governments and 3.45 crore doses administered till December 2017. Since the claim was made in May 2018, the number might have reached the 4 crore doses. Hence, the claim is TRUE. However, this shift to IPV is part of the larger global movement against Polio and as mandated by GPEI. How many doses of Rotavirus were administered? The second claim is that ‘Rotavirus vaccine launched in March 2016. Nearly 1.5 crore doses administered to children’. Rota Virus Vaccine has been introduced to reduce mortality and morbidity caused by Rotavirus diarrhea. Presently, the vaccine has been introduced in 9 States, namely, Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Odisha, Assam, Tripura, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu & Madhya Pradesh through domestic funds. Till November, 2017, around 1.29 crore doses of Rotavirus vaccine have been administered to children in above mentioned States since its introduction. In the next phase, Rotavirus vaccine will be introduced in Jharkhand. An answer provided in Lok Sabha from March 2018 states that ‘the Government had launched Rotavirus vaccine in the year 2016 to prevent Rotavirus Diarrhoea. Rotavirus vaccine has been administered to about 1.41 crores children across these nine states (as on February 2018)’. While the number in the data obtained is lower than the one in the claim, it is also pertinent to note that these numbers only concern the 9 states in which the vaccination has been introduced and till February 2018. Hence the numbers might have increased by the time the claim is made in May 2018. Claim: Rotavirus vaccine launched in March 2016. Nearly 1.5 crore doses administered to children. Fact: The Government had launched Rotavirus vaccine in the year 2016 to prevent Rotavirus Diarrhoea. It was administered to about 1.41 crores children across nine states as on February 2018. Hence, the claim is TRUE. How many children were covered under the measles rubella vaccination campaign? The third claim is that ‘Measles Rubella (MR) vaccination campaign launched in Feb 2017. Around 8 crore children vaccinated’. MR vaccine is being introduced through campaign, targeting around 41 crore children in the age group of 9 months to 15 years in a phased manner (covering ⅓ of the total population of the country), followed by 2 doses in routine immunization at 9-12 months and 16- 24 months, replacing the measles vaccine. MR campaign started in February, 2017 from 5 States/UTs (Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Goa, Lakshadweep and Puducherry), where 3.34 crore children were vaccinated against the target of 3.43 crore with a coverage of 97%. The next phase started for 8 States/UTs from August, 2017 namely Andhra Pradesh, Chandigarh, Daman & Diu, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Telangana, Kerala, Himachal Pradesh & Uttara hand where around 3.21 crore children have been vaccinated by December, 2017. An answer in Lok Sabha from July 2018 clarifies that ‘following the campaign, Measles-Rubella (MR) vaccine is introduced in Routine Immunization replacing two doses of measles vaccine. The Measles-Rubella campaign started from February 2017 and has been rolled out in 21 states/UTs by July, 2018, covering nearly 9.2 crore children’. It has to also be noted that the government of India introduced measles vaccine across the country in 1985 under the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP). To further reduce the measles burden, a second dose of measles vaccine was introduced in the country in the year 2010. Claim: Measles Rubella (MR) vaccination campaign launched in Feb 2017. Around 8 crore children vaccinated. Fact: The Measles-Rubella campaign started from February 2017 and has been rolled out in 21 states/UTs by July, 2018, covering nearly 9.2 crore children. Considering that the claim was made earlier than the data collected, it is TRUE. However, it has to be noted that the government of India introduced measles vaccine across the country in 1985 under the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP). To further reduce the measles burden, a second dose of measles vaccine was introduced in the country in the year 2010. How many children have been vaccinated with PCV? The last claim is that ‘Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) launched in May 2017. Around 15 lakh doses administered to children’. PCV was launched in May, 2017 for reducing Infant mortality and morbidity caused by pneumococcal pneumonia. The vaccine has been introduced in Himachal Pradesh, 6 districts of Uttar Pradesh and 17 districts of Bihar. Till December 2017, around 11.20 lakh doses of PCV have been administered to children in the above mentioned areas. An answer in Lok Sabha states that “As per National Technical Advisory Group on Immunization (NTAGI) recommendation, Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) and Rotavirus vaccine (RVV) have been introduced in a phased manner in the Universal Immunization Programme (UIP) as per availability of vaccine and resource’. Claim: Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV) launched in May 2017. Around 15 lakh doses administered to children. Fact: PCV was launched in May, 2017 for reducing Infant mortality and morbidity caused by pneumococcal pneumonia. Till December, 2017, around 11.20 lakh doses of PCV have been administered to children. More updated data on the beneficiaries is not available. Hence, the claim remains UNVERIFIED.

113,"[Claim]:Varanasi woman beheaded six Muslim men who threatened her with rape and conversion, reported UP Tak[Evidences]:An image of an apparent report by UP Tak (a Lucknow-based media outlet from India Today's 'Tak' cluster) is viral in which it is claimed that a Dalit woman is absconding after beheading six Muslim men who threatened her with rape and conversion. The incident allegedly happened in Hemantpur village in Varanasi's Babatpur. The report also states that the relatives complained to the police several times, but the police neither gave the woman any protection nor took action taken against the Muslims.Twitter handle @maheshyagyasain tweeted this apparent report and seemingly approved the woman's alleged act. (Archive)User @anamikasinghIN also tweeted the report and cited the incident as an example of feminine power. (Archive)बलात्कार और धर्मांतरण की धमकी देने पर 6 मुस्लिम युवको का गला काट दलित हिंदू युवती फरार ; बाबतपुर स्थित काली मंदिर से 6 कटे सिर बरामदनारी शक्ति ,🪓🪓💪💪 जय हिंदू राष्ट्र जय श्री राम जय भवानी pic.twitter.com/ZOFhcIhHpr — Anamika Singh (@AnamikasinghIN) June 18, 2023This image was shared by several others, including verified users. (Archives- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)This slideshow requires JavaScript.This image has also been circulated several times on Facebook.The viral image is also being circulated on YouTube. One can find instances here, here and here.Fact CheckWe found a notice tweeted from the official Twitter account of DCP Gomti Zone Commissionerate of Varanasi refuting the viral claims. The notice announced that some Twitter handles were posting 'fake news' about six Muslim youths being beheaded for threatening rape and conversion and that a Dalit Hindu girl was absconding. They further clarified that the news of six heads being recovered from Babatpur Kali Temple is also completely untrue. No such incident happened in Babatpur under police station Phulpur of Varanasi Gomti zone. The notice also mentions that legal action will be taken against those who share such posts.We also found certain irregularities in the apparent report. To begin with, there are several mistakes in the 'report', starting from spelling errors to errors in sentence structures. We also noticed that there was a 'close quotes' towards the end of the text, but there was no 'open quotes'. The errors/irregularities have been pointed out below:Further, as the reader may notice, the report contains an image of policemen standing in front of a temple. It would be natural for us to assume that the picture, seemingly related to the incident in question, was clicked in front of the Maa Kali Temple in Babatpur where the Dalit girl is supposed to have offered the heads of the Muslim men she killed. But, we found that the temple in the picture is actually the Salori Temple in Allahabad, which is approximately 135 km from Babatpur. Below is a comparison.Moreover, the image of policemen joined at the bottom of the temple photo is actually a file image used by The Indian Express several times in the past (1, 2). Below is a comparison of the two images.Another thing to note in the viral image is the graphic at the bottom left corner. The graphic, seemingly an advertisement showcasing the key points of the Madhya Pradesh budget 2022-23, is actually more than a year old. This graphic was originally made by a Hindi media outlet called Webdunia and carries a watermark. This graphic was used by Webdunia in a March 2022 report titled, 'MP बजट में कोई नया कर नहीं,13 हजार टीचरों की होगी भर्ती, कर्मचारियों का डीए 31 फीसदी बढ़ा'.Furthermore, no such report with the same headline is available on UP Tak's website since June 13 (the date of the alleged incident). We were also unable to find any other news report related to this incident.UP Tak tweeted a fact-check of this image, and wrote, 'This fictitious news being spread on social media with the name (Logo) of UP Tak is completely untrue and misleading. Please do not pay attention to such misleading news. Varanasi Commissionerate has also denied this news. Police will take legal action against those who share such posts'. They also stated the same in a fact-check report.Hence, the image of UP Tak report claiming that a Dalit girl beheaded six Muslim men who threatened her with rape and conversion in Babatpur is fake. According to police, no such incident was reported. UP Tak also clarified that it had not published any such report.Donate to Alt News!Independent journalism that speaks truth to power and is free of corporate and political control is possible only when people start contributing towards the same.

114,"[Claim]:“Lagos has an estimated waste generation of over 15,000 tonnes every day.”[Evidences]:A newspaper article urging more recycling in Nigeria made a number of claims about the waste produced in the country.Its claim that Nigeria produced 0.65 kilograms of waste per person a day was mostly correct. But not data shows that the country generates over 62 tonnes of waste a year.Two claims on Lagos’s waste generation and the city’s population were unproven.Piling waste posed a “grave danger” to people in Nigeria, a national newspaper said, putting them at risk of environmental hazards and epidemics.As Africa’s most populous country struggled to come to grips with the problem, recycling solid waste could help prevent disasters, Nigeria’sGuardiansaidin May 2019.The article made a number of claims about waste in Nigeria. We checked four of them.Claim “Nigeria generates over 62 million tonnes of waste a year.” Verdict incorrectThe article’s statistics were gathered duringa development awards ceremonyin Lagos in March 2019, its author Adaku Onyenucheya told Africa Check.She could not recall who had provided the figures as a recording had been lost. But she said she had been referring to waste in general, not only solid waste as the headline ofthe reportsuggests.TheUN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizationdefines waste as “material left over after products have been made by producers and after they have been used by consumers”.We tracedthe figureof 62 million tonnes to a 2012World Bank report titledWhat a waste: A global review of solid wastemanagement.But the statistic was for sub-Saharan Africa. The reportestimatedthat Nigeria alone produced 40,959 tonnes of municipal solid waste a day,or 14.95 million tonnes a year.It definedmunicipal solid wasteas waste collected by municipalities from residences, industries, institutions and construction.The2018 editionof the report has data for 2016, when solid waste generation in Nigeria rose to34.6 million tonnes. But it did not have data on non-solid or liquid waste, according to thebank’sSocial, Urban, Rural and Resilienceunit.We therefore rate this claim as incorrect based on the most recent publicly available national data.How were these figures calculated?To arrive at its most recent estimate, the World Bank relied on a number of sources. These included peer-reviewed journal articles and cited academic papers. Where data was not available, it relied on its studies and those from other donors or project documents.Models were then used to project future waste generation. These suggested that Nigeria would produce 54.8 million tonnes of solid waste in 2030, and 107 million tonnes in 2050.There was an acute lack of data on waste management in Nigeria and many other African countries, said Prof Oladele Osibanjo, president of the Lagos-based Waste Management Society of Nigeria .The National Bureau of Statistics told Africa Check it did not have data on waste generated by Nigerians.Waste generation was a “highly variable parameter” affected by factors such as the city and even the seasons, said Dr Chidozie Nnaji, a water resources and environmental engineering researcher at the University of Nigeria , Nsukka.Nnaji said most waste generation studies were localised, and there was a danger in “over-generalising” their results.Claim “Each person [in Nigeria] generates an average of 0.65 kg of waste per day.” Verdict mostly-correctIn its 2018 report, the World Bankestimated thateach person in Nigeria generated an average of 0.5 kilograms of solid waste a day in 2016.The report gave Nigeria’ population as 186 million people in 2016. But the country’s statistics bureauestimatedthe 2016 population at just over 193 million. There's been no official population count since 2006, and those figureswere mired incontroversy.Other sources showed that each person’s average waste generation was close to the claim, analysts told Africa Check.A survey of waste management in Abuja byChibueze Ogwueleka,published in 2013, estimated it at 0.63 kilograms per person.Obiora Ezeudu is an environmental engineer and researcher at thecentre for environmental management and control,University of Nigeria.He told Africa Check that this study “assumed that Abuja has equal representation of all Nigerian entities in terms of culture and ethnicity and socio-economic”. These factors influenced the waste generation rate, Ezeudu said.Dr Thaddeus Nzeadibe, a senior lecturer in the geography department of theUniversity of Nigeria, said Ogwueleka’s rate of 0.63 kilograms per person was a sound estimate.“I don’t seem to have an idea of any other study done on Nigeria’s per capita waste generation,” said Nzeadibe, who has a doctorate in environmental management. “His rate is a clear representation of Nigeria’s per capita waste generation.”But he added that “because it was done in 2013, it is possible the rate would change if the study was done in 2019”.Claim “Lagos has an estimated 21 million inhabitants.” Verdict unprovenIn2016, the National Bureau of Statistics estimated Lagos’s population at12.6 million.But this figure is contested. The Lagos state government’s websitesaysthe population is21 million, the number given in the Guardian’s article.What could explain this difference?Dr Isiaka Olanrewaju isthedata agency’sdirector of household statistics. He told Africa Check that to estimate Nigeria’s 2016 population, the agency used both its own survey and projections from the National Population Commission.But Lagos took a different approach, Olarewaju said.""The commission based its calculations on who was seen physically during the census, whereas Lagos state based its calculations on those who were usual residents of Lagos state, whether seen or not seen during the period.""Claim “Lagos has an estimated waste generation of over 15,000 tonnes every day.” Verdict unprovenTheLagos Waste Management Authorityis responsible for the state’s waste collection and disposal.DrOla Oresanyahas headed the agency for more than 10 years. He chose to use a “safe” population figure 20 million, and estimated that an average person in Lagos generated 0.5 kilograms of waste daily.But this “may have increased to 0.6 kilograms because of an increase in affluence and rate of generation”, he told Africa Check. The city produced about 10,000 to 12,000 tonnes of all forms of waste a day, he estimated.But, again, Lagos’s population is contested, with estimates ranging from 12 million to 21 million. And the World Bank’s2018 reportestimated that only 10% of the city’s waste was collected.We therefore rate the claim as unproven.https://africacheck.org/reports/the-jewel-in-the-crown-lagos-governor-hopefuls-fact-checked/",False,Conflicting
115,"[Claim]:List of double entrendres collects ""the top nine comments made by NBC sports commentators during the Summer Olympics.""[Evidences]:This mirth-provoking list of “the top nine comments made by NBC sports commentators during the Summer Olympics,” a collection of facepalm statements and double entrendres, is dusted off every four years and recirculated online to much social amusement. Although we can’t guarantee that no sports commentator anywhere ever said any of these things, the age of this list and its inclusion of hoary urban legends (such as the “kiss his balls” tale) and items attributed to a variety of different sports figures over the years puts paid to the notion that all the entries issued from the mouths of NBC Olympics commentators. Similar lists with somewhat differently worded entries attributed to other people (and featuring some non-Olympic sports) have been making the rounds since at least as far back as 1999, such as the following example from in Australia circulated during the run-up to the 2000 Olympics in Sydney: “We actually got the winner three minutes from the end but then they equalised.”(Ian McNail — Football) “This is really a lovely horse; I once rode her mother.”(Ted Walsh — Horse Racing Commentator) “We now have exactly the same situation as we had at the start of the race, only exactly the opposite.”(Murray Walker — F1 Motor racing Commentator) On the difficulties of adjusting to playing football and living in Italy: “It was like being in a foreign country.”(Ian Rush — Footballer) “Bill Frindal has done a bit of mental arithmetic with a calculator.”(John Arlott — Cricket Commentator) “I’ve never had major knee surgery on any other part of my body.”(Winston Bennett — Footballer) “The lead car is absolutely unique, except for the one behind it which is identical.”(Murray Walker — F1 Motor racing Commentator) “I owe a lot to my parents, especially my mother and father.”(Greg Norman — Golfer) “Sure there have been injuries and deaths in boxing — but none of them serious.”(Alan Minter – Boxer) “The racecourse is as level as a billiard ball.”(John Francombe — Jockey) “If history repeats itself, I should think we can expect the same thing again.”(Terry Venables — Football Coach) “We’ll still be happy if we lose.

116,"[Claim]:A 37-year-old Florida man who was arrested for kidnapping 27 people and “forcing them to play Yahtzee for 36 hours straight.”[Evidences]:A supposed Tweet shared by CBS News on Jan. 16, 2021, claimed to describe a 37-year-old Florida man who was “arrested for kidnapping 27 people and forcing them to play Yahtzee for 36 hours straight.” A photograph that accompanied the alleged Tweet showed a red-headed man who appeared to be very sunburned, which our team used to conduct a reverse-image search. The search engine TinEye returned more than 45 results, the oldest of which originally dated back to March 2016. According to the public domain photograph, the featured man was then 22-year-old Brett Gonzales, who was booked on March 15, 2016, on suspicion of burglary of a religious building. A link back to an article published two days later by the news outlet NOLA.com revealed that officials in Louisiana’s Tangipahoa Parish arrested Gonzales, who lived in the town of Tickfaw at the time, after he allegedly burglarized the Little River United Pentecostal Church. “Detectives said they recovered the stolen property and returned it to the church. The property included a 32-inch flat-screen television, a DVD player, surround-sound speakers and a portable stereo/ CD player, the sheriff’s office said,” wrote the publication at the time. The original author of the meme in question is not yet known, but it made its first appearance on the giph and meme website iFunny by user perfectpics. The account, which had 1,400 followers, also featured other memes and doctored images. To rule out the possibility that CBS News possibly ran the photograph by mistake, we combed through the publication’s Twitter feed dating back to the Jan. 16 timestamp shown on the meme. A Tweet that matched the widely circulated meme was not found. Snopes also contacted the news outlet for confirmation of any possible association but did not hear back at the time of publication.",False,False

118,"[Claim]:Illegal immigrants and refugees living in Britain get a yearly benefit of £29,900.[Evidences]:We've seen versions of this post about state support for pensioners and refugees, which has been shared almost 2,000 times on Facebook, before. We first checked the very same figures back in 2012 , and we also checked a similar version last year . It's incorrect on every figure. A full British state pension (before top-ups and without partner support) is worth either £126 a week or £164 a week (around £6,500 or £8,500 per year) depending on when you were born. Partner support for a state pension recipient is worth up to £68 a week (around £3,500 per year)—but has not been open to new applicants since 2010 and will end next year. People staying in the UK illegally aren't entitled to claim anything from the UK state. Refugees in the UK (in other words, people who have had an asylum claim approved) aren't entitled to any particular benefits aimed at them. They can receive the same benefit and pension payments as any UK citizen. It is theoretically possible to receive £29,900 a year in household benefits, but this would be unusually high. Asylum seekers (who are applying for refugee status in the UK) are entitled to around £38 per week per person if they are homeless and unable to afford food. Honesty in public debate matters You can help us take action – and get our regular free email I'm in What can a British pensioner claim? The full basic state pension is £125.95 a week (excluding top ups ) for a man born before 6 April 1951 or a woman born before 6 April 1953. Pensioners born after this date can claim the new state pension—the full weekly rate is £164.35. People need to have 30 qualifying years (or 35 for the new state pension) of national insurance contributions to claim the full rate. Given that the viral image refers to a pensioner who paid national insurance their entire working life, we can assume that they have the 30 qualifying years. This means a full state pension is worth around £6,500 a year before top-ups—or around £8,500 if it's the new state pension. We are not aware of any ""hardship allowance"" for pensioners, but they can claim state benefits (some of which are pensioner-specific) to help with their income. What about pensioners' spouses? A pensioner's spouse may be entitled to a state pension in their own right. Additionally, a state pensioner may get an "" Adult Dependency Increase "" if they have a partner who is financially dependent on them. The Department for Work and Pensions told us the full rate is £68.35 a week—around £3,500 a year. However, this hasn't been open to new applicants since 2010, and will stop in April 2020. What can someone who is in the country illegally claim? Nothing. People who are staying in the UK illegally are likely to be removed if their immigration status is discovered by the authorities, so they wouldn't be able to claim benefits without alerting the authorities to their status. They inherently do not have the right to work in the UK. What can a refugee claim? It depends whether you're talking about an asylum seeker or a refugee . An asylum seeker (who is making an application for refugee status in the UK) can get £37.75 per week, if they are homeless and not able to afford food. They can also be allocated some form of accommodation (which they cannot choose and is unlikely to be in London or the South East). Asylum seekers don't get a ""spouse allowance"", rather an asylum seeker's spouse would be entitled to the same amount in their own right if they were also seeking asylum. We aren't aware of any ""hardship allowance"" for refugees (as was the case when we checked the claim in 2011 ), and have asked the Home Office for more information. This means an asylum seeker's total entitlement is £37.75 per week (or £2,000 per year)—well below the £675 per week claimed in the viral image. Where does the £29,900 figure come from? If an asylum seeker is granted refugee status in the UK, they could then claim benefits, tax credits and pension payments on the same basis as UK nationals. There aren't any specific benefits available just for refugees. It is theoretically possible —but very unlikely—for a refugee household to receive £29,900 a year in benefits, just as it is for UK nationals. This would only occur if they weren't subject to the benefit cap. Under the cap, the maximum total benefits a household in London containing a couple or a single person with children can receive is £23,000, or around £442 a week. The cap is lower if you're a single adult or live outside London. Some people are not affected by the benefits cap, for example people over state pension age, and people getting Universal Credit because of a disability or health condition that stops them working.",False,False
119,"[Claim]:""In Texas, there are 668 Democratic Hispanic elected officials to the 60 in the Republican Party.""[Evidences]:Heads up: Another Bush is raising his profile.As noted in a March 3, 2012, Texas Tribune news article, attorney George P. Bush, the son of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and nephew of former President George W. Bush, has been pitching afresh for a group he helped found, the Hispanic Republicans of Texas.""Politics is in my blood,"" the Tribune story quotes Bush as saying in a story about the group's political action committee.But Rebecca Acuña, spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party, sounded skeptical of the PAC’s chances of helping Republican Hispanics advance. Acuña told the Tribune: ""They are delusional if they think they’re making any inroads with Latinos. In Texas, there are 668 Democratic Hispanic elected officials to the 60 in the Republican Party.""Do Hispanic Democratic elected officials so greatly outnumber their Latino Republican counterparts in Texas?Looked entirely like it -- at first.To our inquiry, Acuña sent us portions of a 2011 directory of Latino elected officials compiled by the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, which describes itself as the nonpartisan leadership organization of the nation's more than 6,000 Latino elected and appointed officials.The chart provided by Acuña says that of 2,520 Hispanic elected officials in Texas in January 2011, 668 were Democrats and 60 were Republicans, matching the figures aired to the Tribune. Two school board members were counted as Independents.According to the chart, 496 elected Latino officials in Texas held nonpartisan offices, mainly serving in municipal government or on school boards, and another 1,294 Latino elected officials, also mostly serving on school boards or in municipal offices, were listed as ""no party stated.""And how does NALEO gather all this?A methodology section of the 2011 directory says the NALEO Educational Fund has regularly attempted to tabulate Latino elected officials since 1984. For the 2011 check, NALEO staff contacted each identified official by phone or fax to ask whether they were indeed Latino, the group says.""The phone verification process proved invaluable,"" the methodology section says. ""Many individuals having Spanish surnames were in fact, not Latino. Conversely, other individuals with non-Spanish surnames were identified as being Latino.""Rosalind Gold, a senior director for the NALEO Educational Fund, told us in a telephone interview that how officeholders self-identify has proved pivotal. ""We very much rely on self-identification in determining who is and who is not Latino,"" Gold said.By email, Martha Recio, a NALEO research assistant, confirmed the figures cited for 2011.At our request, NALEO also composed a chart showing its identified party breakdowns for Texas Latino elected officials for 2001 through 2011.The group’s determinations of party affiliations have been incomplete because, Gold told us, so many local offices are filled in non-partisan elections; such candidates do not run as party nominees. In each of the years, at least 68 percent of the Latino elected officials tabulated by NALEO were not identified by party affiliation.Also, Gold said, if the group could not verify an officeholder’s party membership by telephoning their office, it did not attempt to do so by tapping other sources. NALEO doesn’t have resources to do that, she said. Sometimes, too, Gold said, an officeholder declined to discuss his or her party membership.We asked Gold if it’s fair to make comparisons limited to its counts of Republican and Democratic Latino elected officials when most of the group’s identified Latino elected officials are not identified by party. Gold replied that this is the kind of context NALEO provides when discussing its counts. ""We say that of the elected officials we were able to verify affiliation for, here is the party breakdown,"" she said.Back to the Texas counts: Among officeholders tabulated as Democrats or Republicans, the share of Democratic elected officeholders dropped from 32 percent in 2001 to 20 percent in 2010 before reaching nearly 27 percent in 2011. The relative share of Latino Republican officeholders was .7 percent in 2001, escalating to .9 percent in 2010 and 2.4 percent in 2011, according to the group.With so many party affiliations not nailed down, we wouldn’t blame anyone for ruling out comparisons of results for different years. That misgiving aside, though, it looks like the ratio of elected Hispanic Democrats to Republican Latinos in Texas has narrowed. The NALEO counts suggest there were nearly 45 Hispanic Texas Democrats per Republican counterpart in 2001, 34 in 2005 and 11 in 2011.Our rulingThe Texas Democratic Party’s spokeswoman correctly cited two figures from the 2011 NALEO directory suggesting that Latino elected Democrats in Texas greatly outnumber their Republican counterparts.Still, this claim is missing substantive context -- that NALEO did not determine the party memberships of most Latino Texas officeholders. If this were done, the Democratic-Republican ratio might change.We rate the claim Mostly True.",True,True

121,"[Claim]:Hold your breath for 10 seconds or 1 minute to check if you have COVID-19[Evidences]:Quick Take Multiple posts have come up on social media claims that there is a ‘self test’ to see whether you got COVID-19. Some posts claim that you do not have COVID-19 if you can hold your breath for 10 seconds, while some others claim that it is 1 minute . We investigated and found all these claims about ‘holding breath to check COVID’ to be false. The Claim Multiple claims are doing rounds on social media suggesting people to hold their breath to understand if they have COVID-19. One such post even goes to the extent of suggesting that people infected with the novel Coronavirus will have 50% pulmonary fibrosis. An archived version of one such post is here and the snapshot can be seen below. Noted Yoga guru Ramdev has apparently also made a similar claim asking people to hold breath for 1 minute in order to check if they are patients of COVID-19. Fact Check Is there a self test for COVID-19? There are a number of online symptom checker launched by various organizations across the world. Even the Indian Govt.’s official App Aarogya Setu has a self-assessment for COVID-19 based on visible symptoms like fever, sore throat, tiredness, dry cough etc. If symptoms suggests positive, patients are advised for further blood investigation to be sure about whether they have COVID-19 or not. The USFDA has recently approved a blood test kit for self testing of COVID-19 at home. These tests are to be done in consultation with the doctors and as per instructions. But ‘holding the breath’ is not a symptom checker or a valid test for the disease. Will all COVID-19 patients have breathing difficulties? All COVID-19 patients will NOT have same symptoms. Also, the severity of a particular symptom vary from person to person. As per Sanjeev Jain, Consultant – Pulmonologist, Fortis Hospital, Delhi, “We are seeing only a handful patients who actually complain of breathing problems. It is lesser than half of the COVID patients we treat.” So, saying ‘all patients will have breathing problems’ or ‘if you have COVID-19 you will not be able to hold your breath’ is not a right thing. What is fibrosis of lungs? Will all Coronavirus patients end up having 50 percent pulmonary fibrosis? Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a form of interstitial lung disease that causes scarring in the lungs. It is a progressive disease and increases with age or time. In this disease the lung tissues become hard and cannot expand or contract easily making it difficult for the patient to breathe. Dr. Jain says, “Patients who have severe respiratory complications may progress to severe ARDS which may lead to fibrosis of lung. But that does not mean every COVID patient will end up having fibrosis of lung. There is no studies done to measure that even in case of pulmonary fibrosis it will proceed to 50%. The data will vary from hospital to hospital, as per their expertise in treating such patients.”",False,False
122,"[Claim]:Elon Musk could have given everyone in America $1 million (and still have had $7 billion left over) instead of purchasing Twitter for about $40 billion.[Evidences]:In the wake of the news that Elon Musk had purchased Twitter for $44 billion, a number of social media users suggested that the Tesla CEO’s money could have been better spent elsewhere. He could have, they suggested, solved world hunger or ended poverty. One viral tweet claimed that Musk could have given every single person in the United States $1 million (and still have $7 billion leftover) for roughly the purchase price of Twitter: The math here doesn’t quite add up. Using the population figure in the tweet, if Musk really decided to dole out $40 billion to everybody in the United States equally, every individual would get about $121.21. The number 1 billion is written as a 1 followed by nine zeroes, or 1,000,000,000. Another way to describe a billion is a “thousand millions.” Forty billion, then, is 40 thousand millions. If Musk were to hand out the $40 billion in $1 million increments, only 40 thousand people would receive a payment. This isn’t the first time that bad math has been employed to criticize people with vast amounts of wealth. In fact, the above-displayed tweet was followed up with a message about a similar incident in March 2020 when MSNBC anchor Brian Williams, while reading a viral tweet, said that former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg could have given every American $1 million instead of spending $500 million on ads. Politifact did the math on that one and found that if Bloomberg’s $500 million for ad purchases were divvied out equally, every American would get about $1.53. “If that sounds too good to be true,” Politifact reported, “it’s because it is. A quick use of acalculatorshows that $500 million divided by 327 million people is actually about $1.53 per person.” As of this writing, Musk is considered the richest person in the world, with a fortune of about $270 billion. While that’s not enough money to give every person in the United States $1 million, it is a fortune of near unfathomable size. In 2021, when Musk’s fortune was approximately $195 billion, YouTuber Humphrey Yang visualized Musk’s wealth with grains of rice.

124,"[Claim]:""Poll Finds 38% of Americans Say They Will Not Drink Corona Beer Because of Virus.""[Evidences]:If coronavirus hadn’t yet caught your attention, maybe disturbing news about the widening health threat and beer did. CNN, Esquire and other American mainstream news media reported incorrectly on a survey examining consumers’ feelings about the coronavirus and Corona beer. Some of those news stories, shared on Facebook, were topped by this errant headline: ""Poll Finds 38% of Americans Say They Will Not Drink Corona Beer Because of Virus."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The survey was done by a New York City firm, 5W Public Relations. The firm announced the results on Feb. 27, 2020, as public health concerns rose in the United States. The next day President Donald Trump held a news conference about the nation’s response to coronavirus. The survey ""via phone"" of 737 American beer drinkers over age 21 on Feb. 25 and 26 was done ""regarding their opinions about the popular Mexican beer brand, Corona, as a result of the deadly coronavirus that's spreading around the world,"" the PR firm’s news release said. So, this was a survey of beer drinkers, not of Americans overall. The first result reported in the release: ""38% of beer-drinking Americans would not buy Corona under any circumstances now."" The release also does not say whether the survey was representative of American beer drinkers. The firm did not provide us the results of other questions, but told us these were the questions used in the survey: Are you a beer drinker? Are you a Corona drinker? Is Corona related to the coronavirus? In light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona? Would you buy Corona in a store? Would you order a Corona in a restaurant/bar/public venue? Would you buy Corona under any circumstances now? The questions asked by the firm underscore the problems with the reliability of this poll. And because the PR firm won’t release more details, it’s ultimately untrustworthy. Respondents, for instance, were asked if Corona is related to the coronavirus but were never told it isn’t. They were then asked a leading question, ""In light of the coronavirus, do you plan to stop drinking Corona?"" that suggests some correlation between the beer and the virus even though there is none. And some respondents may have said they don’t drink Corona and would continue not to drink Corona. Nevertheless, the news release to the media was clear that the 38% figure applied to beer drinkers, not Americans overall. At PolitiFact, we’re used to seeing a fair number of either misleading polls, or misleading reports about polls. In this case, the lack of transparency by the polling firm (a PR company) means you should be skeptical, too. Some news organizations, however, were not. You can read PolitiFact’s guide to polling to better understand what to look for and what types of polls to stay away from. A statement shared on Facebook said: ""Poll Finds 38% of Americans Say They Will Not Drink Corona Beer Because of Virus."" The poll was of American beer drinkers, not Americans overall. Other details of this ""poll"" — including the specific question asked — are unknown, so it’s difficult to say beer drinkers wouldn’t drink Corona beer because of the virus, or some other reason.

125,"[Claim]:Subramanian Swamy stating that Adani did not acquire the 74% shares of Mumbai Airport from the Indian government, but instead purchased them from multiple foreign partners who Congress sold in 2006[Evidences]:A social media post featuring an image of former BJP MP Dr. Subramanian Swamy claims that he made a statement regarding Adani’s Mumbai Airport acquisition. The post alleges that Swamy said, “The truth is that Adani did not buy these 74% shares from the Indian government but bought 74% from multiple foreign partners which Congress had sold in 2006!”. Let’s verify the claim made in the post. Claim: Subramanian Swamy stating that Adani did not acquire the 74% shares of Mumbai Airport from the Indian government, but instead purchased them from multiple foreign partners who Congress sold in 2006. Fact: These statements were not made by Dr Subramanian Swamy. In fact, Swami accused Adani of not repaying the loans and using nepotism to obtain stake in Mumbai Airport. Also, Adani Group has 74% stake in Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, post the stake purchase transaction, with 50.5% being bought from GVK Group and 23.5% Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), and Bidvest Group. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. During our investigation, we found that the same post was shared in 2021 when Adani Group acquired a 74% stake in Mumbai International Airport Limited. However, the statements were not attributed to Dr Subramanian Swamy at that time. We also searched through Swamy’s various social media accounts and also checked multiple media reports, but we could not find any evidence of him making the statement referred to in the social media post. However, during the process of Adani’s acquisition of Mumbai Airport from the GVK group in 2021, Swamy made allegations that Adani had not repaid the loans and had used nepotism to secure the Mumbai airport deal. Recently, during a Parliament speech on 07 February 2023, Rahul Gandhi made a series accusations against the Adani Group, stating that they were handed control of the Mumbai airport after it was taken away from the GVK. Dr Swami in an interview on 29 January 2023, while discussing the Hindenburg report on the Adani Group, once again accused Adani of using investigative agencies to pressure the GVK group into giving up control of the Mumbai Airport. However, the GVK group denied “extraneous pressure” from anyone to sell the Mumbai airport. Coming to Adani’s Mumbai Airport acquisition, as per the media reports, Adani Group has a 74% stake in Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport, post the stake purchase transaction, with 50.5% being bought from GVK Group and 23.5% from minority partners including Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), and Bidvest Group. To sum it up, there is no conclusive evidence to support the assertion that Subramanian Swamy made any statements regarding the Adani Group and the Congress Party in relation to the Mumbai airport deal.",False,True
126,"[Claim]:Says that 500,000 federal workers -- one-fourth of the federal workforce -- make more than $100,000 a year.[Evidences]:To bolster their case to reduce the size and cost of government, Republicans often say federal employees are overpaid. During an Aug. 15, 2011, town hall in Litchfield, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney cited salary figures to make the point.""I found it surprising that over a quarter of federal workers make more than $100,000 a year -- 500,000 federal workers make more than $100,000 a year.'' Romney said.To back up the claim, the Romney campaign cited figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics that say the total federal civilian work force is 2.2 million federal employees, not including postal workers. The campaign also cited a USA Today report from July 2011 that said there were ""nearly"" 500,000 workers earning $100,000 or more.We checked with the Office of Personnel Management, which keeps data on federal employees and salaries. According to its Fed Scope database, the total civilian workforce was 2.14 million in June, the most recent month for which information was available. And at that time there were 459,016 federal workers who made at least $100,000 in average base salary each year.That’s a little short of the 500,000 Romney claimed. It accounts for 21.5 percent of government employees, not 25 percent as he said. It's about 22 percent if you just look at ""permanent"" federal employees, which excludes temporary employees, student interns, the legislative and judicial branches along with the Postal Service and the military.""Governor Romney said over one quarter of federal workers make more than $100,000. He meant to say nearly a quarter,'' said Ryan Williams, a campaign spokesman.Some studies have claimed that government workers earn higher salaries than private-sector workers, but federal officials say that's an apples and oranges comparison. OPM Director John Berry has said the studies fail to recognize that federal jobs require workers who are more educated and need higher skills.John Palguta, vice president with the Partnership for Public Service, a group that encourages people to work in government, said the studies don't prove that federal workers are overpaid.""There is no convincing evidence that a significant percentage of those federal employees who are paid above $100,000 a year are being paid at a level that is above what major private sector employers pay their employees in similar occupations, with similar levels of responsibility, and which require similar knowledge, skills, and abilities,’’ he said.It's worth noting that studies show federal salaries rose significantly under former President George W. Bush, and then by greater amounts under President Obama.Our RulingRomney was slightly off by saying 25 percent, but the actual number is 21.5 percent, so he was in the ballpark.

127,"[Claim]:The media ignored Kim Rhode's bronze medal-winning performance in the 2016 Summer Olympics due to her stance on gun rights.[Evidences]:Shortly after U.S. shooter Kim Rhode won a bronze medal for women’s skeet shooting on 12 August 2016 at the 2016 Summer Olympics, her sixth medal in as many Olympiads, a rumor took root holding that the news media had purposefully ignored her accomplishments due to her support of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump and the 2nd amendment: Rhode has now earned a medal at the last six Summer Olympic Games, a feat no other woman has ever accomplished. While one could argue that her victory deserved more media attention, it’s incorrect to say that the media ignored her victory, and disingenuous to claimthat the reason was due to hersupport for the second amendment and Donald Trump. Stories about Rhode’s historic victory were published by multiple major U.S. news outlets, includingUSA Today, the New York Times, CBS Sports, SB Nation, NBC, WGN, and the Chicago Tribune. Other prominent national publications suchasTime, Forbes, the Huffington Post,andNPR published articles aboutRhode’s accomplishments that highlighted her views on the Second Amendment. Although both Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal acknowledged that there is a stigma attached to shooting sports which limits sponsorship opportunities outside the firearms industry, they also noted that shooting isn’t attractive to big-name sponsors simply because it isn’t a widely followed sport in America: The rise in gun violence and mass shootings in the US have attached a stigma to shooting as a sport, they say. So while companies like Winchester, Beretta and Otis Technology support Rhode, she doesn’t have a single sponsor from outside the firearm industry. Politics may only tell part of the story. American television audiences don’t tend to watch shooting — or, for that matter, a number of other sports. “The biggest challenge is limited exposure,” said Peter Carlisle, head of the Olympic Sports and Action division at Octagon Worldwide. “If the sport itself doesn’t provide a consistent platform for the athletes to become recognizable and maintain relevance, there’s limited value to a sponsor.” A survey conducted by Five Thirty Eight found that shooting was ranked as one of the least popular events at the 2016 RioOlympics, and the sport was not listed in an Adweek survey announcing the“11 Olympic Sports That Viewers Are Most Excited About Watching.” While controversy over gun issues may be a contributing factor to Rhode’s lack of major sponsorship opportunities, it isn’t a new issue or one specific to her particular political stances. Wheaties, the General Mills cereal famous for picturing athletes on their boxes since 1934, has never featured a shooter.

128,"[Claim]:""Ending (Temporary Protected Status) and deporting legal workers would cost the United States ~$164 billion in GDP over a decade.""[Evidences]:Democratic Congressman Joaquin Castro claimed the U.S. economy would be negatively impacted if the Trump administration eliminated an immigration protection mostly benefitting Central Americans. The U.S. government routinely reviews whether to extend or terminate a country’s Temporary Protected Status designation, applied to countries with ongoing armed conflict, natural disasters, epidemics and other extraordinary, temporary conditions preventing the safe return of their nationals. Opponents of this status argue that while the protection is intended to be temporary, some designations are continuously renewed, allowing some recipients to stay in the country for many years. But Castro said ending it would come at a real cost of lost workers. ""Ending #TPS and deporting legal workers would cost the United States ~$164 billion in GDP over a decade,"" Castro tweeted on Nov. 1, ahead of the deadline for the U.S. government to decide on the current TPS status for Honduras and Nicaragua. Ending #TPS and deporting legal workers would cost the United States ~$164 billion in GDP over a decade. We must #SaveTPS. The United States on Nov. 6 decided to end Nicaragua’s designation, effective in 2019. Honduras’ designation, set to expire Jan. 5, 2018, was extended until July 5, 2018, because the Department of Homeland Securitysaid it needed more time ""to obtain and assess"" additional information. We wanted to know if Castro’s claim on gross domestic product losses was accurate. The Texas representative'stweet is based on a report from a left-leaning organization whose calculation included immigrants’ potential lost earnings and industry chain reactions. Another group’s estimates, without industry output calculations, found a lower GDP loss of $45.2 billion. Castro’s office told us the congressman’s claim stemmed from an October report from the Center for American Progress, a liberal public policy research and advocacy organization. The group supports the designation, which is currently in effect for 10 countries: El Salvador, Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, Sudan, South Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. Immigrants living in the United States illegally as well as individuals on a valid nonimmigrant visa may apply for Temporary Protected Status if they meet certain criteria. Receiving the protection allows them to get work permits and avoid deportation, but does not lead to lawful permanent resident status. The center focused on GDP losses tied to recipients from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti, the countries with the most beneficiaries. TPS holders from those three countries ""are employed at high rates,"" and are ""key contributors"" to the industries of construction, restaurant and other food services, landscaping services, child care, and grocery stores, the report said. The group’s analysis is based on estimates from the Center for Migration Studies of New York of about 302,000 TPS beneficiaries from those three countries (estimated using recent census data). If an estimated 244,200 beneficiaries from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti are removed from the workforce, the United States would lose $164 billion in GDP over the next decade, the Center for American Progress report said. The calculation derives from a broader, separate study on GDP loss resulting from the removal of unauthorized workers in the United States. The researchers multiplied the number of employed TPS recipients with the losses associated with each unauthorized worker. ""By both assuming that the skill distribution of the workforce with TPS reflects that of the broader unauthorized workforce and expressing data in 2013 dollars, this analysis reflects a conservative estimate,"" the report said. The only other estimate of the potential consequence of ending this program that we could find was even more conservative. An April report from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center estimated a much lower GDP loss over a decade — $45.2 billion — without the wages of an estimated 190,000 TPS individuals from El Salvador, Honduras and Haiti. Nicole Svajlenka, coauthor of the Center for American Progress analysis, said her team’s numbers are much higher because they considered ""all that goes into a GDP, which is beyond earnings."" ""We take into account workers’ educational attainment, nativity, and work experience as well as the industry composition to determine what would change if that worker was removed,"" Svajlenka said. ""Basically, we’re simulating some chain reactions — without these workers, some industries would shrink, other workers would shift, etc."" Several researchers we reached out to said they had not done their own, independent analysis on this issue, but did not challenge Center for American Progress’ findings. David Dyssegaard Kallick, director of immigration research at the Fiscal Policy Institute, said it is sound to look at industry output when thinking about GDP loss. ""GDP, after all, is about measuring total output in the economy,"" he said. The center’s GDP estimates can also be seen as conservative ""since they do not take into account impacts associated with the likely withdrawal of a significant number of U.S.-born children of TPS holders,"" said Raul Hinojosa-Ojeda, an associate professor in the UCLA Department of Chicana and Chicano Studies. He added that TPS workers are also supporting the people hiring them, helping them generate profits. Many TPS holders also bought houses and have mortgages, said Hinojosa-Ojeda. Castro tweeted, ""Ending #TPS and deporting legal workers would cost the United States ~$164 billion in GDP over a decade."" Castro accurately cited GDP loss reported by the left-leaning Center for American Progress. But at least one other report pegged a GDP loss three times as small, $45.2 billion. The report Castro used calculated lost earnings and impact on industries, the other report only looked at lost wages. We rate Castro’s claim Half True.",Conflicting,Conflicting

""In New York, when she ran for reelection, she carried 58 of our 62 counties. George Bush had won 40 counties in New York just two years earlier,"" he said. He is suggesting Sen. Hillary Clinton's strong reelection showing in Republican-leaning counties in 2006 means she can win nationwide, a key question facing her candidacy. It is true that she carried 58 out of 62 New York counties, and that President George Bush had won 40 counties in New York just two years before. In the interview, the former president delved further into the numbers from the 2006 race, in which she beat Republican John Spencer by more than 2 to 1. ""In the counties that President Bush won, she got a reelection margin of about 60 percent, which means some -- a lot of Republicans and conservative independents voted for her, because they know her now, and they like her, and they saw her in action working for them,"" he said. That's not far off the mark from what pollsters say about the reasons for Hillary Clinton's strong showing in her 2006 reelection. Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Media Research, says she gained 18 percentage points among independent voters from 2000 to 2006 -- even better than her 15-point gain among moderates. But he and others also attribute the increase to the fact that Mrs. Clinton was a well-known incumbent with a weak Republican challenger. And she also had the advantage of a national wave, fueled by the unpopularity of President Bush and the Republican-led Congress, that propelled Democrats nationwide in 2006 and helped them regain control of the U.S. House and U.S. Senate. Mrs. Clinton may not be able to count on moving independents elsewhere. A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 47-percent of independents nationally view her unfavorably. ",True,True

132,"[Claim]:Soon after getting leave, this soldier rushed to Delhi border to meet his father, who has been protesting against the farm laws for 75 days.[Evidences]:A set of two pictures, one of them showing a man embracing a young Sikh soldier, is going viral on social media in the context of the ongoing farmers’ agitation. It is being claimed that soon after getting leave, the soldier came to meet his father at Delhi border, where he has been protesting against the farm laws for 75 days. India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found the claim along with the pictures to misleading. The picture was taken not in Delhi but Punjab’s Ludhiana. The claim is being widely circulated on Facebook and Twitter. Some verified Twitter handles have also shared the post. The archived version can be seen here. AFWA investigation We did not find any credible news report regarding the viral pictures. But with the help of some clues in the pictures, AFWA ascertained that they are from Ludhiana. The viral pictures show a board of shipping company “FedEx” behind the men and another with “PARKING BUS STAND” written on it. Though it can’t be seen clearly, a closer look at the second board reveals “LUDHIANA” printed just below the words “BUS STAND”. Some other boards in Punjabi can also be seen. Using related keywords, we found that a “FedEx” outlet is indeed located near Ludhiana bus stand. AFWA reached out to the owner of this “FedEx” outlet Surinder Bansal with the help of the contact number given on the Internet. Bansal confirmed to us that the viral pictures are from outside his shop near Ludhiana bus stand. He, however, could not tell us anything about the soldiers seen in the pictures. Our Ludhiana correspondent visited the same place and clicked some pictures to authenticate the information given by Bansal. These pictures show exactly the same boards as seen in the viral photographs. We also have a video of this location in which the board of “PARKING BUS STAND” can be seen. India Today could not verify the identity of the soldiers or the two other men seen in the viral pictures. But it is clear that they were clicked at Ludhiana and not Delhi, and the accompanying post is also misleading.

133,"[Claim]:""We have over a million (legal immigrants) a year, more than at any time in the history of this country. We have the largest percentage of immigrants, almost tied now with the historical high as a percentage of immigrants living in this country.""[Evidences]:In a discussion over the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, prior to President Donald Trump’s announcement to repeal it, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., said immigration laws should be vigorously enforced. That’s because legal immigration has hit a record high. ""We have record levels of legal immigration… We have over a million people a year, more than at any time in the history of this country,"" Santorum said on CNN’s State of the Union on Sept. 3, 2017. ""We have the largest percentage of immigrants, almost tied now with the historical high as a percentage of immigrants living in this country."" Are more immigrants coming into the United States legally than at any other time in history, and are they on track to outnumber previous immigrant populations? The number of annual legal immigrants has been higher in the past. But Santorum has a point that the United States is on pace to surpass general immigration proportions (although it’s not there yet). A total of 1,051,031 persons were granted lawful immigration status in 2015, the latest year recorded by the Homeland Security Department. Over half of those were already living in the United States. That encompasses those who received a green card, were admitted as temporary nonimmigrants, were granted asylum or refugee status, or are naturalized. That is over a million, as Santorum said, but it’s not the highest it’s ever been. There were 1,090,172 legal immigrants granted status in 1989; 1,535,872 in 1990; and 1,826,595 in 1991. Between 2001 and 2014, there were 11 years in which lawful immigrants also surpassed 1 million, eight of which surpassed the 2015 rate. And it’s not a recent phenomenon. Between 1905 and 1914, there were six years in which legal immigration surpassed 1 million. Four of those had higher immigration rates than 2015. And that’s significant because it was a much larger percentage of the population compared to today. Immigration law largely explains the trends above. The lack of numerical restrictions on entry before 1924 (except for Chinese immigrants) meant that nearly every immigrant was legal, making the early numbers more representative than the current ones (as illegal immigration is unaccounted for in the chart). It also meant fewer deportations than today. The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 legalized 2.7 million unauthorized immigrants, reflected in the spike between 1989 and 1991. And more recent spikes are explained by the American Competitiveness in the 21st Century Act, the Real ID Act, and backlog reductions at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. If Santorum had been talking about both illegal and legal immigrants combined, the number of annual immigrants would be slightly higher today, but still not a record. The Census Bureau found that nearly 1.5 million legal and illegal immigrants had arrived in the United States in 2014, but 1.66 million arrived in 2000. The total 2015 number isn’t yet available, but it was projected to reach 1.6 million. On the overall number of immigrants, Santorum is correct. The Census Bureau estimates there are 43.3 million foreign-born people in the United States, which beats all previous records. Pew Research Center places that number at 45 million. But the overall population of the United States has more than tripled from 1900 to 2000, which means we should also look at percentages of the population. The immigrant share of the U.S. population was 13.5 percent in 2015. That still doesn’t surpass the record high immigrant shares in 1910, 1890 and 1870, which were 14.7 percent, 14.8 percent and 14.4 percent respectively. Data collection began in 1850. The percentage of the overall population that was foreign born was only a little higher back then (while the absolute number of immigrants was high) because proportionally, more people went back home and immigrants, like citizens, suffered a higher death rate than today. As Santorum said, we are on track to beat the record. The Center for Immigration Studies projects the United States will surpass the 14.8 percent marker in 2023, driven largely by legal immigration. Pew projects the fast-growing immigrant population will push the share of the foreign-born U.S. population to a record of 18 percent in 2065. When asked if recent changes in immigration policy could alter those projections, Center for Immigration Studies director Steven Camarota said they likely wouldn’t, as the immigrant percentage of the population has never grown as exponentially as it has since 1970 (from 4.7 to 13.5 percent). Columbia University immigration historian Mae Ngai said we should be wary of population trend predictions to begin with, as they are based on assumptions that don’t always hold true. Santorum said, ""We have over a million (legal immigrants) a year, more than at any time in the history of this country. We have the largest percentage of immigrants, almost tied now with the historical high as a percentage of immigrants living in this country."" While we do have over 1 million annual legal immigrants, it’s been surpassed multiple times in both recent years and at the turn of the twentieth century. We are still a few years away from exceeding the record from last century of the share of immigrant population, and that’s based on projections.

134,"[Claim]:The 2009 stimulus bill ""failed to get people back to work.""[Evidences]:The Democrats’ massive stimulus program passed two years ago was a dud, according to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor.""They (Democrats) passed a nearly $1 trillion stimulus bill which failed to get people back to work,"" Cantor, R-7th, said in a May 26 news conferenceof House Republican leaders.Cantor is referring to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed in February 2009. Democrats pushed the legislation as a way to create jobs and extend unemployment benefits through a mix of government spending, tax cuts and financial aid to cash-strapped states. It adds $830 billion to the budget deficit between fiscal years 2009-2019, according to the Congressional Budget Office.Let’s turn to the crux of the majority leader’s assertion -- that the measure failed to get people back to work. How does Cantor justify that statement?In an e-mail, Cantor spokeswoman Megan Whittemore characterized his statement as a broad proclamation that the stimulus failed. She noted that the unemployment rate is higher now than when the stimulus passed, that there are more discouraged workers and that private sector growth in May was much slower than expected, she said.""Of course, when the government spends that much money it’s able to hire additional government workers, but it failed to spur real private sector growth,"" Whittemore said.Cantor didn’t specify in his statement what kinds of jobs he was talking about -- public or private. So we won’t give him the benefit of his staff’s elaboration after the fact.Also, the economic statistics Cantor’s office cited don’t address whether there were people who returned job rolls as a result of the stimulus.Cantor simply said the stimulus ""failed to get people back to work.""Is that true? We decided to check.The White House has posted on its stimulus websitea listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. Between February 17, 2009 and March 31, 2011, the U.S. had a reported 573,510 full-time equivalent jobs funded by stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans, which account for one-third of the cost of the stimulus.Virginia had a reported 11,446 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans.White House data shows the bulk of the Virginia jobs -- 7,203 full-time equivalent positions -- were in downtown Richmond where the state government relied on stimulus funds to balance budgets from 2009 to 2011. That number may paint an exaggerated picture, however, because the state parceled much of the stimulus money to localities to help support schools.Even so, the statistics suggest a benefit to Cantor’s constituents in suburban Richmond counties, many of whom work for the state government. The data shows 178 full-time equivalent jobs arising from the stimulus were located in Cantor’s district.The Government Accountability Office has criticized the White House tallies, noting in a November 2009 report that there were ""significant reporting and quality issues"" in how the figures were compiled.For more insight, we contacted the Virginia Department of Education. Charles Pyle, a spokesman, said that as of January 2011, Virginia school divisions reported they had saved 5,692 jobs and created another 926 jobs using stimulus money.In a reportreleased March 18, 2011, the president’s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 2.5 and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010.Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional budget office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found:*CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. *IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created.*Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created.*Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created.Many conservative economists balk at the methodology of these studies, which they say depends on assumptions that government stimulus automatically generates a net gain in economic activity. Conservatives have argued government stimulus doesn’t boost the economy, but merely shifts around dollars that could be better spent by the private sector. They’re also concerned deficit spending creates uncertainty for businesses looking to hire.Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute, is among those skeptical the stimulus is a net plus for the nation’s employment picture. In an Aug. 2, 2010 column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, he wondered how many private-sector jobs were lost or not created because he said the stimulus shifted money from the private sector to the government.But does that mean that the stimulus failed to put people back to work?In an interview, DeHaven said the stimulus program did create jobs, at least in the short term.""On one hand, it creates jobs,"" DeHaven said. ""But at what cost?""To sum up:Cantor said the stimulus ""failed to get people back to work.""A variety of national studies estimate the measure saved or created at least 1.3 million jobs. The reports do not break down how many of the positions were new and how many were existing jobs that didn’t get cut. They do not tell us how many of the jobs were in the private sector and how many were public ones.But they do provide ample evidence that the stimulus did get people back to work.

135,"[Claim]:There are ""500 failing schools in North Carolina""[Evidences]:In vouching for a law that would allow some struggling public schools to be taken over by charter schools, the state chapter of the conservative group Americans For Prosperity said one in every five North Carolina public schools is failing. ""This Achievement School District legislation is a small first step testing one approach to the long-overdue process of improving 500 failing schools in North Carolina,"" wrote AFP’s North Carolina director, Donald Bryson, on the group’s website. North Carolina has 2,583 public schools, including 148 charter schools. So if Bryson is right about 500 failing schools, that means nearly 20 percent of schools fall into that category. His proposed solution, a relatively new and controversial program called an achievement school district, or ASD, is moving forward in North Carolina. The ASD program was approved by the N.C. House on June 2 (the day after Bryson published his argument) and is now up for a vote in the Senate. The idea is to take a handful of the lowest-performing schools away from their districts and turn them over to charter school operators. Bryson said it’s noteworthy that there are 500 failing schools because such schools ""remain broken education communities, systematically failing to teach tens of thousands of students without any path towards meaningful, long-term reform or improved achievement."" We wondered if the picture was really so bleak. How many schools are failing? The state has give out school grades since the 2013-14 school year. Last year,146 schools received Fs. That’s a far cry from 500, so we asked Bryson where his number came from. He said he was actually underestimating it – that there are 547 low-performing schools, according to a state law that defines the term. However, ""low-performing"" is not the same as ""failing"" –the law that Bryson cited includes F schools as well as D schools. And as any slacker can tell you, D’s get degrees. For Bryson to count D schools as failing seems to be self-evidently wrong. But that’s not the whole story. The state gave its schools a grading scale that we all would’ve loved to have had ourselves. While a typical grading scale gives any score below 60 an F and then goes up by 10-point intervals, North Carolina uses the following scale to grade its schools: F: 0-39 D: 40-54 C: 55-69 B: 70-84 A: 85-100 The scores are mostly based on how students do on standardized tests, with a small amount of consideration given to whether the schools met their expected student growth goals. Grades for high schools also include factors like graduation rates. If the state used a traditional scale, every D school (and even some C schools) would have instead received an F. That’s a pretty good argument in Bryson’s favor. We decided we needed to talk to an expert on education policy to determine whether the state had a good reason to give itself this scale, or if it was simply protecting its image. Eric Houck is a former public school teacher who now teaches education policy at UNC-Chapel Hill. He said many academics, including himself, don’t really pay attention to school grades – including the question of whether the scale is too generous. The rubric doesn’t give much weight to how much students improved in a given year, Houck said, and instead focuses mostly on raw scores. He said that punishes schools for having students who came to them below grade level and largely ignores how well teachers did getting those students caught up. ""The entire grading system is a little suspect in terms of being able to accurately identify what schools are actually failing,"" he said. Using growth to measure schools The ""low-performing"" metric that Bryson cited includes all D and F schools that didn’t meet their growth goals, as well as those that met their growth goals. Those that exceeded their growth goals are not considered low-performing. That’s a bit more in line with Houck’s philosophy on how to best judge schools, but it’s still misleading to say all those students are being left behind. By equating ""low-performing"" with ""failing,"" Bryson’s claim considers a school to be failing if its average student is a D student whose scoresare improving as much as the state expects. A reasonable person wouldn’t say that student is failing. He’s below average, but above the threshold for failure and on track for improvement. And nearly half of the schools Bryson is talking about, 225 of them, arein that category. Paying a bit more attention to growth, like Houck suggested, we found that a better estimate of the number of failing schools could range from 80 to 415, depending on how much you trust the state to have given itself a fair grading scale. 80: The number of F schools in 2014-15 that did not meet their expected growth. 146: The number of F schoolsin 2014-15. 299: The number of low-performing schools that did not meet their expected growth (out of 547 total low-performing schools). 415: The number of schools that scored 59 or below in 2014-15 and thus would’ve received an F on a traditional grading scale, and which also didn’t meet growth goals. Our ruling It’s hard to say exactlyhow many failing schools are in North Carolina, but we do know there are not 500 like AFP state director Donald Bryson said. He was referring to low-performing schools, but the majority of low-performing schools are D schools – which most people don’t consider failing. We counted failing schools in a number of ways, with the results ranging from 80 to 415 depending on the grading scale used to define what an F is. Any way you slice itthere are clearly dozens, and maybehundreds, of failing schools statewide. Bryson’s statement was overly broad, but it’s not totally wrong.

136,"[Claim]:Al Gore predicted that Earth’s “ice caps” would melt away by 2014.[Evidences]:In the years 2007, 2008, and 2009, Al Gore made statements about the possibility of a complete lack of summer sea ice in the Arctic by as early as 2013. While Gore attributed these predictions to scientists, they stemmed from a selective reading of aggressive estimates regarding future melting. The comments became a popular talking point for human-cause climate change deniers in 2014 and onward when the predictions, which in some cases were overstated, did not pan out: On 10 December 2007, in his Nobel prize acceptance speech, Gore said: Last September 21, as the Northern Hemisphere tilted away from the sun, scientists reported with unprecedented distress that the North Polar ice cap is “falling off a cliff.” One study estimated that it could be completely gone during summer in less than 22 years. Another new study, to be presented by U.S. Navy researchers later this week, warns it could happen in as little as 7 years. Here, Gore referred to a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) announcement and two different climate studies, one of which became the source for his most aggressive statements. On 21 September 2007, NOAA did announce that sea ice had hit its lowest recorded point in history. The second, more aggressive estimate for when summer sea ice would disappear in the Arctic came from a conference talk at the 2007 American Geophysical Fall Meeting, which was undertaken by researchers associated with the Naval Postgraduate School and was presented later that week. The BBC reported that the study did make the prediction that Gore claimed: Scientists in the US have presented one of the most dramatic forecasts yet for the disappearance of Arctic sea ice. Their latest modelling studies indicate northern polar waters could be ice-free in summers within just 5-6 years. Professor Wieslaw Maslowski told an American Geophysical Union meeting that previous projections had underestimated the processes now driving ice loss. The BBC article also noted that Maslowski’s group, frequently cited by Gore, often made predictions that were more aggressive than their peers’: “Professor Maslowski’s group, which includes co-workers at NASA and the Institute of Oceanology, Polish Academy of Sciences (PAS), is well known for producing modelled dates that are in advance of other teams.” On 13 December 2008, Gore appeared to have made a similarly flawed statement while speaking at the opening of a German natural history museum. Although transcripts and clear audio are hard to find, one video of the event documented Gore’s saying that “The entire North polar ice cap may well be completely gone in 5 years.” Given the dates presented, it is likely that Gore was once again referring to Maslowski’s data, and unless he preceded his statement with some qualification not captured by the video, Gore’s statement either intentionally or accidentally neglected to mention that this prediction, aggressive as it was, concerned only summer sea ice. On 14 December 2009, during a speech at the Copenhagen Climate Conference, Gore cited newer research from the same group, saying: “These figures are fresh. Some of the models suggest to Dr [Wieslav] Maslowski that there is a 75 per cent chance that the entire north polar ice cap, during the summer months, could be completely ice-free within five to seven years.” That statement put Gore in hot water when Maslowski told rhe Times of London that his data did not allow for such a prediction: “It’s unclear to me how this figure was arrived at,” Dr Maslowski said. “I would never try to estimate likelihood at anything as exact as this.” Mr Gore’s office later admitted that the 75 per cent figure was one used by Dr Maslowksi as a “ballpark figure” several years ago in a conversation with Mr Gore. The claim that Gore “predicted” an ice-free Arctic in 2014 is a simplification of these events. However, Gore was definitely guilty in these cases of cherry-picking science or playing loose with the details of that science. Gore’s statements gained the most viral attention in 2014 and 2015, both because these were years in which Gore’s statements implied an ice-free summer in the Arctic and because those years had relatively more arctic sea ice than preceding years. From a broad perspective, however, summer sea ice in the Arctic has in fact been declining at faster rates relative to 20th century, and the year 2016 tied with the year 2007 (the year highlighted by Gore in his Nobel speech) for the second least Arctic summer sea ice on record (the lowest recorded sea ice extent occurred in 2012). While the disappearance of summer sea ice is difficult to predict, a 2013 review of different approaches (including Maslowski’s) summarized the range of various predictions for the first ice-free summer in the Arctic: We have investigated three approaches to predicting 21st century summer Arctic sea ice loss as represented by trendsetters, stochasters, and modelers [three quantitative approaches used to make predictions]. At present, it is not possible to completely choose one approach over another as all approaches have strengths and weaknesses … Time horizons for summer sea ice loss of these three approaches turns out to be roughly 2020, 2030, and 2040 respectively for trendsetters, stochasters, and modelers … It is reasonable to conclude that Arctic sea ice loss is very likely to occur in the ﬁrst rather than the second half of the 21st century, with a possibility of loss within a decade or two. Arctic sea ice is without question on a declining trend, but Gore definitely erred in his use of preliminary projections and misrepresentations of research. Because Gore himself did not claim to have made these predictions, however, and because his statements applied specifically to summer sea ice in the Arctic, we rate the claim that Gore “predicted the ice caps will melt by 2014” as a mixture.",Conflicting,Conflicting

139,"[Claim]:""I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table.""[Evidences]:If it weren’t for Democratic presidential candidateHillary Clinton, there likely wouldn’t yet be an Iran nuclear deal, according to theformer Secretary of State. While her Republican rivals who oppose the Iran deal might use that line against her, Clinton has touted progress with Iran as one of the hallmarks of her tenure at the State Department. ""I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table,"" she said at the MSNBC Democratic forum Nov. 6. She’s said this line a few times throughout her campaign, so we decided to dig into it. According to her campaign, Clinton was referring to her first 18 months as secretary -- from January 2009 to June 2010. During this time, U.S. and global sanctions on Iran increased, it’s fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development. The invitation Upping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton’s State Department. She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity, including through sanctions, at her nomination hearing in January 2009. She and other members of President Barack Obama’s administration regularly spoke publicly about the topic throughout her first 18 months in office. During this time period, the State Department -- top aides and Clinton herself -- led the diplomatic lobbying effort to get other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China to get on board. In her memoir Hard Choices, Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official. In June 2010, the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran -- including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises. At the time,Obama called them ""the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government."" Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union, which were passed immediately. Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton’s tenure, which ended in early 2013. While the Treasury is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions, Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U.S. efforts ""to ensure full and effective implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran, including most recently UNSCR 1929."" Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran, and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program. The RSVP The State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U.S. efforts to pressure Iran, said Patrick Clawson, senior fellow and research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. He added that her claim doesn’t give enough credit to other players but is essentially correct. Clawson specifically noted that he is ""not a fan nor a political supporter of Clinton."" The international sanction ramp-up ""shocked Iran's leaders,"" Clawson said. ""Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted, they raised the possibility more -- worse -- was coming. That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks."" There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U.S. government are involved in the Iran effort, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction-making and implementation, she said. And in the absence of the United Nations resolution -- Clinton’s lobbying success -- it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions, she said. But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear, Maloney said. Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions, but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted. Beyond the multilateral effort, Clinton’s team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed, said Richard Nephew, an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration (as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article). Nephew noted, though, that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration’s wishes. ""Without SecretaryClinton's good diplomacy -- and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth -- you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting,"" Nephew said. Congress’ sanctions that affect Iran’s oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table, said Nephew, who worked at the State Department under Clinton. Our ruling Clinton said, ""I spent 18 months putting together the sanctions against Iran so that we could force them to the negotiating table."" Clinton’s claim is for the most part accurate, though a little exaggerated. During her first 18 months as secretary, the State Department was at the helm of a global effort to increase sanctions on Iran, culminating in an important U.N. resolution. Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly. And experts said these sanctions, on top of other sanctions passed before and after, were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table. However, Clinton wasn’t singularly responsible for the sanctions, just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely weren’t singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks.

140,"[Claim]:Says 12 restaurants and food companies are ""supporting Trump’s re-election.""[Evidences]:A popular social media hoax is trying to link about a dozen chain restaurants to President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign. According to the rumor, which has been shared widely on social media platforms, businesses like In-N-Out, Taco Bell and Olive Garden are supporting the president in the 2020 presidential election. The photo lists 12 such companies. ""Not much of a fast food eater but just in case I get a craving this is motivation to eat healthier for sure!"" one Instagram caption reads. (Screenshot from Instagram) This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, Instagram’s parent company.) The Washington Post wrote about this fast food rumor Aug. 9 after a college student’s tweet of the list went viral. It amassed nearly 250,000 retweets, helped partially by a quote tweet from Chrissy Teigen, a model and TV personality. ""So if you see me starting to get thinner and toned don’t ask me why,"" the original tweet reads. In a reply to his original tweet, the original poster, whose real name is Zuriel Sanders, linked to five webpages as evidence. None of them back up his claim that 12 restaurants are directly supporting Trump in 2020. Two links are from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks political donations. The first shows that Chick-Fil-A employees, owners or their family members donated $36,530 to candidates during the 2016 election, with the bulk of the money going to Republicans. But that’s money from the last election cycle, it went to all national politicians (not just Trump) and, as a note on the website states, none of that money was donated by the company itself. The second link shows the top contributors in the food and beverage industry to candidates in 2019-2020. McDonald’s Corp. tops the list with $238,220, the majority of which has gone to Republicans. Waffle House, Inc. also made the top 10 with $68,950 going to Republicans and other conservatives. McDonald’s did not respond to our request for comment. But a closer look at the company’s political contributions show that there’s no evidence to suggest it’s directly supporting Trump in 2020. RELATED:Does a portion of every Bang energy drink purchase go to Trump re-election efforts? Not exactly The Center for Responsive Politics does not have data to indicate that individuals and PACs associated with the company have donated to Trump so far this election cycle. Numbers from the 2016 election show that Hillary Clinton was the candidate with the most single contributions. What the data do show about 2020 contributions is that the McDonald’s PAC has contributed $98,500 to federal candidates so far, with the lion’s share going to Republicans. None has gone to Trump so far, according to the Center’s data. We looked at political contributions from the other 10 companies, and their associated PACs, listed in the Instagram post. We found that only one of them, Taco Bell’s TACO PAC, supported Trump in 2016. And only a PAC affiliated with Vital Pharmaceuticals, the company that owns the energy drink Bang, has contributed money to Trump’s 2020 re-election, as we noted in a previous fact check. Finally, Trump isn’t the top recipient of money from the food and beverage industry so far. Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., is. The other three links the original tweeter included as evidence for his claim are three news stories. They speak to the political leanings of fast food restaurants’ owners and operators, but they don’t prove the claim that 12 companies are supporting Trump in 2020. The first link is to an article from a site called The Cheat Sheet. It claims to reveal the political leanings behind several popular restaurant chains. Chick-Fil-A, Pizza Hut, Waffle House, KFC, McDonald’s, Wendy’s and IHOP are conservative, the site says. As evidence, the article points to news reports about each company’s past political contributions, which have mostly gone to Republican candidates. But those stories don’t mention the companies’ PACs contributing to Trump directly. A 2016 Eater story cited by the Cheat Sheet even says so: ""Restaurant PACs — at least those on Eater’s list — aren’t donating to Clinton or Trump. Instead, PACs tend to work for the best interests of the company as a whole,"" reads the story, which analyzed political contributions from PACs supported by Wendy’s, Chick-Fil-A and Yum! Brands (which owns Taco Bell, KFC and Pizza Hut), among others.

(AP Photo/David Tulis) The second news link the tweeter shared comes from Food & Wine. It reported in 2016 that TACO PAC had ""maxed out its giving to the Trump campaign."" As evidence, the article cited data from the Center for Responsive Politics. They show that TACO PAC gave $5,000 to the Trump campaign during the 2016 election cycle. That PAC has not contributed any money to federal candidates so far this cycle. The last news story the tweeter linked to comes from Salon. It reported on five ""radically conservative fast food companies,"" which included Chick-Fil-A, Carl’s Jr. and Waffle House. That article points to other media accounts and interviews with the company’s founders and executives that elucidate their views. For example, Salon wrote about how Chick-Fil-A President Dan Cathy has spoken out in support of the ""traditional family"" and operating by ""biblical principles,"" which echo conservative values. But none of the stories cited prove that the companies in question are directly supporting Trump’s 2020 campaign. PolitiFact reached out to each of the companies listed in the original tweet, save Bang, which we fact-checked before. We rated as Mostly False the claim that the energy drink company gives a portion of each energy drink sale to Trump’s campaign. But the fact-check noted that Bang’s leaders have been outspoken in support of Trump and Bang’s parent company did make a donation to a pro-Trump super PAC this year. Of the 11 companies we contacted, six responded. Here’s what they told us: Chick-Fil-A: ""Chick-Fil-A does not make political contributions. We don’t contribute to a (political action committee)."" IHOP: ""We’re about pancakes, not politics. IHOP as a brand is not involved in providing financial support to either side of the aisle."" In-N-Out: ""At In-N-Out Burger, we have always taken pride in providing the freshest, highest quality food to all of our customers regardless of political party and, as such, we do not take a position on, nor support, individual political candidates."" Olive Garden: ""We don’t know where this information came from, but it is incorrect. Our company does not donate to presidential candidates."" Pizza Hut: ""Pizza Hut does not make donations to presidential political campaigns, and we do not endorse any political parties or candidates. Pizza Hut has no involvement with or control over donations made by our franchisees, who are independent business owners and, like all Americans, are free to donate to or support whomever they wish."" Taco Bell: ""Taco Bell Corp. does not make donations to presidential political campaigns and has no involvement with or control over donations made by franchisees. Our franchisees are independent business people and, like all Americans, are free to donate to or support whomever they wish."" While it’s true that most of the companies named in the Instagram post have contributed money to PACs in the past, including those that mostly support Republicans, we found no evidence that all of them have donated or endorsed 2020 candidates directly. Only Bang’s parent company has contributed to a pro-Trump PAC so far. An Instagram post claimed that 12 food companies are supporting Trump’s 2020 re-election campaign. Campaign contribution data show that, while many of their employees and affiliates give money to Republican candidates, none of the companies mentioned have donated to Trump’s re-election effort directly. One company is associated with a PAC that gave to the president in 2016, and one is associated with a PAC that has given to Trump during this election cycle. News stories speak to the companies’ political views and past contributions, but they don’t prove support for Trump. Six companies denied making direct political contributions and/or endorsing presidential candidates. The post is not accurate. We rate it False.",False,False
141,"[Claim]:COVID-19 cases are “down by 50%” and “daily vaccinations have increased by 85%” since “Biden took office”[Evidences]:CLAIM COVID-19 cases are “down by 50%” and “daily vaccinations have increased by 85%” since “Biden took office” more about the rating framework VERDICT SOURCE: Anonymous, Occupy Democrats, 16 Feb. 2021 DETAILS Lacks context: The claim suggested that the public health situation would have been different if Joe Biden hadn’t taken office by comparing the trends in COVID-19 cases and vaccination from the day of inauguration to the day of publication and by alluding to Biden’s competence. However, the claim didn’t look at the trends before Biden’s inauguration, which showed that they were similar before he took office. Factually inaccurate: According to the official data from the U.S. CDC, the daily number of vaccinations increased by 60% since Biden’s inauguration, not 85%. KEY TAKE AWAY The daily number of new COVID-19 cases in the U.S. fell sharply in January 2021. The COVID-19 vaccination campaign has been steadily ramping up since mid-December 2020. These data alone don’t provide evidence that Joe Biden taking office is having an impact, as the reduction in the number of new COVID-19 cases and the increase in the number COVID-19 vaccinations began weeks before Biden’s inauguration. The new presidency, while not expected to have any significant effects in the first weeks following inauguration, might materialize in future months and years. FULL CLAIM: COVID-19 cases are “down by 50%” and “daily vaccinations have increased by 85%” since “Biden took office” REVIEW The COVID-19 pandemic that swept across the U.S. since early 2020 has caused almost 28 million identified cases and 500,000 deaths in the country. In the midst of this major health crisis, the U.S. have seen an important political shift with the inauguration of Joe Biden on 20 January 2021, succeeding Donald Trump as U.S. president. Claims of significant improvement in the numbers of COVID-19 cases or vaccination rates circulated on social media, attributing the merit to the new administration. For example, this post by Occupy Democrats or this post by The Other 98% alleged that the number of new COVID-19 cases was down 50% and the number of daily vaccinations was up 85% since Biden took office. While data confirm that these trends are present, the numbers in the first example do not match the official figures. Furthermore, such claims are misleading as they don’t compare the trends in the number of new COVID-19 cases and vaccination rates before and after President Biden’s inauguration. Daily number of new COVID-19 cases significantly decreased in January 2021 and the number of vaccination increased The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports the trends in the daily number of newly identified COVID-19 cases (Figure 1). From 20 January 2021—the day when Biden was sworn in—to 16 February 2021 when the Occupy Democrats meme was published, the average daily number of new cases fell steadily from 193,481 to 81,406 cases per day. This means that 4,000 fewer cases were identified on average each day over that 28-day period. Overall, this represents a 58% decrease, which is not far from the 50% figure cited in the meme. Figure 1. New identified COVID-19 cases reported by the CDC as of 19 February 2021. The blue bars represent the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases each day. The red curve represents the 7-day rolling average. Using a 7-day rolling average helps smoothing out the day-to-day variations. The vertical black line marks the inauguration of Joe Biden. However, the number of new cases is of little relevance if it is not viewed in context with the number of tests performed. Indeed, significantly reducing the number of tests would automatically reduce the number of reported cases. It is therefore important to also look at the positivity rate together with the number of cases. The positivity rate is the percentage of COVID-19 diagnostic tests that returned a positive result. The Johns Hopkins University gathered the data from 56 U.S. states and territories and presented a chart of these regions’ positivity rate over time (Figure 2). The positivity rate markedly decreased in 2021, from 9.7% on 20 January 2021 to 5.5% on 16 February 2021, or a reduction of 43%. Based on this analysis, there is a genuine decrease in cases and the decrease isn’t simply due to changes in the number of tests performed. Figure 2. Trends in the COVID-19 positivity rate over time, reported by the Johns Hopkins University as of 19 February 2021. The number of COVID-19 diagnostic tests carried out each day are represented in light orange and those which returned positive results in dark orange. The proportion of positive tests, or positivity rate, is shown as a blue curve. However, the daily number of vaccinations cited in the claim is less accurate. The CDC also presents the number of vaccinations performed per day (Figure 3). Owing to the important day-to-day variations—for example, there are less vaccinations occurring on Sundays—it is important to focus on the seven-day rolling average (red line) rather than on the daily counts. The available average numbers stop on 13 February 2021. As the CDC explained, data from the most recent days are incomplete and still need to be consolidated. During the 25-day period from 20 January 2021 to 13 February 2021, the daily number of vaccinations rose from 965,982 to 1,543,466 doses, up by 60%. While the positive trend in vaccinations is clear, the figure of 60% is very different from the 85% cited in the claims. Figure 3. Daily number of vaccinations performed each day reported by the CDC, as of 19 February. The light blue bars represent the number of doses administered each day. The dark blue bars represent incomplete data: there is a lag in the reporting of administered doses which means that the most recent days are still underreported. The red line represents the 7-day rolling average, which allows to smooth out the day-to-day variations. In general, the claims are accurate in stating that the number of new COVID-19 cases fell and the number of vaccinations steadily increased since the day when President Biden took office. However, analyzing the CDC data shows that the actual figures cited in these claims are inaccurate. The rise in vaccination number and the drop in COVID-19 cases began before President Biden’s took office The claims strongly suggested that the trends in new COVID-19 cases and vaccination is tied to Biden’s policies by using the day of his inauguration as the point of reference. This is apparent in this meme congratulating Biden and referring to his competence. However, in order to properly assess whether President Biden taking office had an impact on those numbers, it would be necessary to compare the variation of COVID-19 cases before and after Biden took office. When we conducted this analysis, we found that the observed trends already began before 20 January 2021. The CDC data showed that the number of daily new COVID-19 cases began dropping on 13 January 2021, one week before the inauguration (Figure 1). During that week, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases decreased from 243,799 to 193,481, which means that 6,289 less cases were identified each day. In fact, the rate at which cases fell was faster one week before the inauguration than during the period between 20 January and 16 February 2021. The positivity data from the Johns Hopkins University exhibited a similar pattern, with the positivity already decreasing since 8 January 2021 (Figure 2). This phenomenon is even clearer when it comes to vaccination. As shown by the CDC data, the 7-day rolling average of daily vaccinations has steadily increased since 14 December 2021. As mentioned earlier in this review, the daily number of vaccinations rose 60% during the 25-day period after President Biden took office. However, it actually rose 278% during a similar 25-day period right before the inauguration, from 27 December 2020 to 20 January 2021. That the daily number of vaccination rose rapidly in the early stages of the vaccination campaign but slowed down when the vaccination operation reached full capacity is unsurprising. Therefore, the slower rate at which vaccinations were performed doesn’t mean that vaccination efforts have weakened since Biden’s inauguration. But it cannot be suggested that the increase of daily vaccination since 20 January is causally associated with Biden taking office. In summary, COVID-19 cases are markedly decreasing in the U.S., while the daily rate of COVID-19 vaccination is steadily rising. However, the figures reported in the viral Facebook memes that we analyzed above are inconsistent with the data from the CDC. In addition, the data available so far don’t support the claim that the trends observed in the daily number of new cases and the number of vaccinations are causally associated with Biden taking office. The fall in the number of new cases and the rise in the number of vaccinations had already started before his inauguration, at a similar or even higher rate.",False,Conflicting
142,"[Claim]:“Wisconsin is one of the few states that doesn’t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day.”[Evidences]:It took all day and then some for Milwaukee election officials to count their mountain of absentee ballots in the 2020 presidential election And those 170,000 votes proved decisive. When the ballots were added to the state total about 3:30 a.m. Nov. 4, Wisconsin swung from a lead for President Donald Trump to a lead for former Vice President Joe Biden. A later canvass and recount confirmed Biden won the state by about 21,000 votes. But the swing and timing sparked an avalanche of misinformation, with Trump and an array of other Republicans claiming there was something nefarious about the late arrival of Milwaukee’s votes. Of course that’s ridiculous: We’ve noted in multiple False and Pants on Fire ratings that the absentee votes from Milwaukee, a Democratic stronghold, were long expected to heavily favor Biden and to come in late. The controversy stems from limitations in state law on when election workers can process absentee votes — limitations that were unchanged despite the massive increase in this kind of voting amid the pandemic. State Sen. Tim Carpenter, D-Milwaukee, raised this point in a letter to the state’s Republican legislative leaders, seeking a bipartisan task force to improve Wisconsin’s voting system. ""Wisconsin is one of the few states that doesn’t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day,"" Carpenter said in the Dec. 11, 2020, news release. ""Allowing this simple change would stop the false accusation that tens of thousands of ballots are secretly being dumped after midnight changing the outcome of the election. We all know our current process and know that is not true. It is just a matter our laws requiring workers to wait until 7:00 AM on Election Day to begin tabulating."" Is Carpenter right that Wisconsin law handcuffs election officials in a way most states don’t? The short answer is yes. The longer answer depends a bit on how you define processing. The National Conference of State Legislatures compiled details on how each state handled absentee ballots for the 2020 election. Their research showed many states limit counting of absentee votes to Election Day — about 30 in all. But few go as far as Wisconsin in not allowing any ballot processing until that day. Only Alabama, Indiana, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Wyoming require that ballots not be processed until Election Day. (Michigan requires smaller cities to wait until Election Day, while those with 25,000 or more people can start a day early.) The timelines vary among the other states, with some allowing ballots to be processed as soon as they are received, while others begin the process a set amount of time before Election Day. A New York Times breakdown of when states are allowed to begin ""pre-processing"" ballots — defined as verifying signatures, opening envelopes and flattening ballots to get them ready for tabulation — shortened that list further, showing only Alabama, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin limiting this to Election Day. We saw dramatically different vote reporting dynamics in states that allow this earlier ballot processing. In North Carolina, for example, where absentee votes can be processed five weeks before the election and counted two weeks before, an early lead for Biden turned into a Trump win as in-person votes were added to the tallies later in the day. Carpenter said Wisconsin is one of the few states that don’t allow absentee ballots to be processed before Election Day. However we define that processing, it’s clear Wisconsin in the extreme minority. Just a handful of states ban election workers from beginning work on absentee ballots before Election Day. We rate this claim True.",True,True
143,"[Claim]:UK government banned Covid vaccine for children age 5-11[Evidences]:""BREAKING: Children in the UK aged 5-11 will no longer be offered COVID jabs,"" reads a tweet posted on September 8. ""The jab was also banned from children who had not turned five by the end of last month. This decision was due to concerns with developmental side effects in children. Wow."" The tweet was published by Simone Gold, a physician and founder of US-based group America's Frontline Doctors, which has repeatedly promoted misinformation about the Covid-19 pandemic. The post garnered more than 17,000 retweets, with variations of it shared around the world, including in Australia, Canada and Mexico. Some Twitter users (here and here) shared Gold's claim to criticise an announcement from New York State Governor Kathy Hochul that children aged 12 and over in the state would be eligible for a new, Omicron-specific booster shot. However, the claim is false. The UK has not banned Covid-19 vaccination for children aged five to 11. The UK opened up Covid-19 vaccination to all children aged five to 11 in February 2022, after initially limiting the jab to clinically vulnerable children. Children in this age group are eligible for the jab if they turned five before September 1. This means that the vast majority of children in the five-11 age group are eligible for Covid-19 vaccination. However, children who turn five on or after September 1 can only get vaccinated if they are clinically vulnerable or are living with someone who is. A representative for the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) insisted the government had not changed its policy. ""There has been no change to the offer of COVID-19 vaccinations for children aged 5-11 years,"" Gavin Dabrera, deputy director of Covid-19 vaccines and epidemiology at the UKHSA told AFP. ""In February 2022, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advised a one-off, non-urgent offer for children aged 5-11 years who were not in clinical risk groups. From the outset, this offer was only applicable to children who turned five years old by 31 August 2022."" The JCVI, which advises UK health departments on immunisation, said in February that the ""one-off programme"" applied to children celebrating their fifth birthday by the end of August. ""The intention of this offer is to increase the immunity of vaccinated individuals against severe COVID-19 in advance of a potential future wave of COVID-19,"" it said. Health experts criticised the move to stop offering the jab to healthy children who turn five from September. ""Children turning 5, about to go to school, seem an excellent candidate for protection from vaccination if their parents choose to do so,"" Christina Pagel, director of University College London's Clinical Operational Research Unit tweeted. ""Why are we removing their choice? Especially with a significant winter wave expected?"" Stephen Griffin, a professor at the University of Leeds's School of Medicine, pointed to the benefits of vaccination for children. ""Covid in children can be serious,"" he told AFP. ""Kids also develop long Covid, which is increasingly well recognised by many experts and policymakers."" ""I am shocked that JCVI were not prescient enough to predict that Simone and her like might weaponise this decision."" Health authorities around the world have pointed out that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccination greatly outweigh the potential risks, including for children. The UK drug regulator Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine -- which is the one offered to children in the country -- was very effective. Gold also falsely claims that the UK banned Covid-19 vaccination for children who had not turned five by the end of August. The UK has not approved the jab for under-fives in the first place, as of September 22. According to the National Health Service (NHS), children are eligible for the jab from the age of five.

144,"[Claim]:Says ""Every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery and countless home brewers.""[Evidences]:The Oregon House voted recently to designate brewer’s yeast as the state microbe. House Concurrent Resolution 12, which honors Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is now in the hands of the Senate after receiving unanimous support in the House. Before it passed, resolution sponsor Rep. Mark Johnson, R-Hood River, hammered home the economic importance of craft breweries to Oregon. ""Designating Saccharomyces cerevisiae, or brewer’s yeast, as the official microbe of the state of Oregon is an important recognition of the impact this little microbe has had on our state’s economy and on our culture,"" Johnson said. ""Every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery and countless home brewers."" All that craft brewery talk made PolitiFact Oregon feel rather parched. Had Johnson just mapped out a summer road trip for us to quench our thirst (for knowledge of Oregon political geography, of course)? Is there really at least one craft brewery in every legislative district in the state? Johnson’s office provided us with a list of breweries by Senate and House district. Every Senate district contains two House districts; we wanted to ensure at least one craft brewing facility exists in each of the 60 House districts. Johnson’s legislative aide, Rainier Butler, said it appeared that every district contained a craft brewery except House District 17, which covers Stayton, Lebanon and Scio. To double check Johnson’s data, we visited the Oregon Liquor Control Commission website and downloaded a spreadsheet of the more than 15,000 alcohol licenses issued by the state. We narrowed the list to the 222 facilities that had active brewery and brewery-public house licenses. These are facilities that make malt beverages and then sell them primarily at wholesale or retail. Mark Friesen, an online producer at The Oregonian, geocoded and mapped the 222 facilities by legislative district. The results confirmed that House District 17 lacks a licensed brewery, as does House District 47, which covers a large portion of East Portland, and House District 4, which covers Central Point, White City and Eagle Point. We checked with the offices of Rep. Dennis Richardson, a Central Point Republican who represents District 4; Rep. Sherrie Sprenger, a Scio Republican who represents District 17; and Jessica Vega Pederson, a Portland Democrat who represents District 47, to see if they knew of any craft brewing facilities in their districts. They did not, though their staff said it was not the type of information they kept close tabs on. We should also note that businesses constantly open and close, so perhaps a craft brewery in those districts recently closed unbeknownst to us or is slated to open soon. However, our map of OLCC licensed breweries also indicated that two more districts — 28 in Beaverton and Aloha, and 40 in Oregon City and Gladstone — lack craft breweries. Johnson’s office said those districts include a branch of McMenamins, which they believe count as craft breweries even if they don’t brew their own beer on site. We’re not sure we buy that. If they don’t brew their own beer on site, they’re just like any other bar serving beer brewed elsewhere. McMenamins does have one pub in each of those two districts, but company spokeswoman Renee Rank confirmed for us that the Beaverton and Oregon City pubs do not brew beer on site. The beer is brought in from other nearby breweries, she said. Lastly, we shared our findings with Brian Butenschoen, executive director of the Oregon Brewers Guild, which represents 103 brewing companies. He couldn’t think of any craft breweries in House Districts 4, 17 or 47, though all the other districts have at least one. ""It’s pretty close, but I don’t think every single one does,"" he said. We asked him if a McMenamins pub that served beer brewed off-site would count in his book as a craft brewery. ""It’s not a super-important distinction to most folks,"" he said. ""Would I count that in my list of breweries? No."" Our investigation found that districts 4, 17 and 47 do not have craft breweries. We’re also skeptical that a McMenamins pub that doesn’t brew on site qualifies as a craft brewery. ""The vast majority of Oregon does have access to quality craft brewery products,"" Johnson said after we shared our findings. ""The craft-brewing industry is incredibly fast growing. It continues to be a bright spot in the midst of an otherwise slow economy."" Even if we exclude the two districts with McMenamins pubs, more than 90 percent of House and Senate districts in Oregon have at least one craft brewery. If Johnson had hedged his statement a bit and said that ""nearly"" every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery, this would be a True. But that’s not what he said. Johnson said in his floor speech that every legislative district in the state has at least one craft brewery. We rate this statement False — and hope to see you out on the beer trail soon to toast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",False,False

On June 26, a few days before this protest, Mayor Lyda Krewson publicized the names and addresses of various St. Louis residents who had written to her about defunding the police department during a Facebook Live stream, which the mayor has regularly conducted during the coronavirus pandemic. The mayor was accused of doxxing these citizens and putting them in danger of retaliation. The protesters were marching to Krewson’s home when they passed by the gun-toting couple. The Washington Post reported: “Resign Lyda, take the cops with you,” they shouted on the way to the mayor’s house in the Central West End, banging on drums and carrying signs that said, “Respect us.” The first-term Democrat had publicly released the names and addresses of some fellow activists, and now they wanted to bring their demonstration to her door. But as the peaceful crowd of about 500 walked along a private, gated street, a white couple who emerged from a marble mansion had something else in mind. Around 6 p.m. Sunday, a barefoot man in a pink collared shirt walked out from the five-story house, carrying a semiautomatic rifle as he appeared to threaten the group. A few feet away, a woman pointed a pistol at the crowd, her finger directly on the trigger. As this video went viral, many people claimed that this couple’s actions were illegal, since they were pointing their weapons at these protesters in a threatening manner. Others, however, claimed that they had the right to defend their home from and claimed that the protesters were trespassing on private property. The St. Louis Dispatch reported: To access Portland Place, the crowd entered through an iron pedestrian gate. The McCloskeys told police the protesters broke the gate to get in. St. Louis police said the couple had called police for help once they saw the large crowd enter Portland Place. The McCloskeys had been at home and heard a loud commotion coming from the street; they went to investigate and saw “a large group of subjects forcefully break an iron gate marked with ‘No Trespassing’ and ‘Private Street’ signs,” police said. “The group began yelling obscenities and threats of harm to both victims,” police said. “When the victims observed multiple subjects who were armed, they then armed themselves and contacted police.” The investigation into this incident is ongoing. The official police report, which we obtained from the St. Louis Police Department, lists the McCloskeys as victims No. 1 and 2, and labels the incident as a case of “trespassing / assault 4th intimidation” by unknown suspects: Incident: Trespassing / Assault 4th IntimidationLocation: 0 block of Portland PlaceDate/Time: 06/28/20 @ 1923Victim #1: 63-year-old White MaleVictim #2: 61-year-old White FemaleSuspect: Unknown Officers responded to a “Call for Help” at the above location. The victims stated they were on their property when they heard a loud commotion coming from the street. When the victims went to investigate the commotion, they observed a large group of subjects forcefully break an iron gate marked with “No Trespassing” and “Private Street” signs. Once through the gate, the victims advised the group that they were on a private street and trespassing and told them to leave. The group began yelling obscenities and threats of harm to both victims. When the victims observed multiple subjects who were armed, they then armed themselves and contacted police.

146,"[Claim]:Covid-19 tests detect any coronavirus, not just the one that causes Covid-19.[Evidences]:A post on Facebook makes a number of claims about the Covid-19 pandemic, centring on the assertion that Covid-19 tests do not test for Covid-19 specifically, but any coronavirus, including ones which cause ""nothing more than cold/flu like symptoms"". (Some coronaviruses cause what we know of as the common cold.) This is false. As we have written about extensively here , the diagnostic test used in the UK is called a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, which looks for the virus's genetic material to see if someone currently has Covid-19. The Facebook post questions the reliability of PCR tests and there is something in this. PCR tests can sometimes indicate that someone does not have the virus when they do (false negative). They can also indicate that someone has the virus when they don't (false positive). It's hard to say how many false negatives and positives PCR tests produce, but in general, these tests are ""highly accurate "". Most importantly, what a PCR test won't do is misinterpret the presence of other coronaviruses as the presence of the virus which causes Covid-19, as this post claims. The possibility that a test might pick up related viruses that have genetic similarities to the virus you're looking for (technically known as ""cross-reactivity"") is something that is looked at when designing PCR tests. For example, one of the earliest PCR testing protocols , which was published on 13 January, specifically checked that the test did not pick up the four human coronaviruses that cause infections including the common cold. Results for a range of available PCR tests show that they do not cross-react with any viruses analysed, including other coronaviruses. Where some of the confusion might have come about is because of the accuracy of antibody tests. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says : ""There is a chance that a positive result means you have antibodies from an infection with a different virus from the same family of viruses.""",False,True
147,"[Claim]:""For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage.""[Evidences]:Now that more than 8 million Americans have signed up for coverage under Obamacare, the White House has all but declared victory after the law’s initially troubled rollout. But many of the law’s critics continue to see the law as a disaster. A reader sent us a newsletter to constituents released by Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a critic of the law and a potential presidential candidate in 2016. Here’s an excerpt from the newsletter, which was dated May 2, 2014: ""Since the implementation of Obamacare, hundreds of thousands of Kentuckians have received cancellation notices from their current health care providers. For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage. Obamacare has been presented to the American people through twisted rhetoric, smoke and mirrors. Obamacare is not good for America and it certainly (is) not good for Kentucky. I would like (to) hear how Obamacare affected you, your family or your small business. Share your story by visiting mywebsite."" The claim that leapt out at us was, ""For every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage."" Could that really be true? We took a look at the data. How many Kentuckians have received cancellation notices? Tracking cancellations isn’t so easy, because cancellations are issued by private health insurance companies, and regulations differ in each state. The Associated Press assembled a comprehensive, 50-state look at Obamacare-related cancellations and concluded that, in Kentucky, 130,000 people received cancellation notices. Meanwhile, the Kentucky Department of Insurance has put the number at 168,000. So a reasonable number for cancellations in Kentucky is probably between 130,000 and 168,000. How many Kentuckians have signed up for Obamacare? The answer depends on your definition of ""Obamacare."" The broader measure includes both signups for private insurance at the state-run Kynect insurance marketplace, as well as signups for Medicaid, the longstanding government-run health insurance program for the poor that Kentucky chose to expand under Obamacare. In late April 2014, the state announced that 82,795 Kentuckians had purchased private plans on Kynect and 330,615 others had qualified for Medicaid coverage, for a total of 413,410. Data from the federal Department of Health and Human Services that counts a few more weeks of signups had slightly higher numbers. Comparing the two numbers Using just these numbers, Paul is either wrong or very wrong. The smaller number -- private-insurance number of signups (82,795) -- is exceeded by the number of cancellations (up to 168,000), but at most, the discrepancy is only twice as big, not 40 times as big. But it’s not clear that this is the right number to use. Paul’s newsletter didn’t only refer to private plans, and the Medicaid expansion was just as much a part of Obamacare as the marketplaces for private health insurance plans. So if you include both types of signups (413,410), then the combined Medicaid and private-insurance signups in Kentucky actually exceeded the number of cancellations by more than double. So Paul’s claim is not just off-base, it’s actually going in the opposite direction. In fact, the 40-times-higher claim is ridiculously off-base. If you take the smallest possible number of signups (82,795, counting just the new private plans) and multiply it by 40, you’d need more than 3.3 million cancellations to make the math work. Yet as of 2011-12, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there were only about 2.2 million Kentuckians who had insurance that could even theoretically be canceled -- either insurance purchased individually or provided by employer. The remainder either had government-provided insurance such as Medicare or Medicaid or were uninsured. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that the number of employers who drop coverage in the future ""could be a real issue,"" but for the 2014 statistics, she said, Paul’s calculation seemed ""wildly off base."" Our inquiries to Paul’s office were not returned. Our ruling Paul said that ""for every Kentuckian that has enrolled in Obamacare, 40 have been dropped from their coverage."" That’s not mathematically possible. If you take the narrowest definition of ""sign-ups,"" there would have to be 3.3 million cancellations in the state for Paul’s statement to be accurate -- and there aren’t even that many Kentuckians with private insurance plans that could theoretically be canceled. In fact, it’s reasonable to argue that more people in Kentucky have coverage through Obamacare than have been canceled. Paul’s statement is so wildly off that we rate it Pants on Fire. UPDATE, May 6, 2014: After we published this item, Paul’s office contacted us to explain how they calculated the 40-to-1 ratio of cancellations to signups. The office said that ""the numbers he used were accurate as of November of last year"" but that staffers failed ""to update the numbers for the newsletter."" Specifically, Paul’s office said that a Nov. 8, 2013, news release from the Kentucky governor’s office reported that 7,011 Kentuckians had enrolled in a private health plan through Nov. 8, compared to the 280,000 Kentuckians who the state believed at the time might be subject to cancellation notices. However, in the six months since, the number of private-plan signups has soared by a factor of 10, while the state released a smaller estimate of cancellation notices (168,000). Even in November, Paul’s estimate was cherry-picked; it excluded the 33,561 Kentuckians who enrolled in Medicaid, a program that saw its eligibility expanded under Obamacare. Even though the new numbers were available to Paul’s staff at the time the newsletter was put together, Paul’s office counted only the first two months of signups and ignored the final six months, a period when enrollment rose steadily. Our ruling stands: Pants on Fire.",False,Conflicting
148,"[Claim]:A three-year-old boy named William Tyrell is missing from his New South Wales, Australia, home.[Evidences]:On 12 September 2014, three-year-old Australian boy William Tyrell vanished from his grandmother’s yard in New South Wales. Tyrell was last seen wearing a Spider Man costume and was playing with his sister at the time of his sudden and unexplained disappearance. An intense effort was immediately launched to locate the little boy, including a thorough search of nearby bushland using dogs. Despite the large-scale investigation, no information has thus far been turned up to explain how or why William disappeared or what may have happened to the toddler. Police said that dogs were unable to locate the boy’s scent, leading them to believe that he may have been abducted rather than wandered off. The plea to help find William gained social media traction and has been widely shared, but law enforcement has yet to turn up any solid leads on what may have befallen the toddler. Police have searched every corner of the caravan park where William lived, and they have also extensively searched adjacent properties (including excavating part of the backyard and draining the septic tank of William Spedding’s Bonny Hills home). In April 2015, police continued their efforts to resolve the case by releasing a video that included home footage of William along with a message from his parents: “If somebody has him, and if he is alive, I want him to be safe, I want him to be feeling loved”: Police in New South Wales have asked anyone with any information about William Tyrell’s disappearance to contact the Australian Crime Stoppers tip line at 1800 333 000.",True,True
149,"[Claim]:California Gov. Gavin Newsom “is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one"" and the election is ""Rigged.""[Evidences]:President Trump claimed on Twitter Tuesday, without evidence, that California Gov. Gavin Newsom is sending millions of ballots to ""anyone living in the state, no matter who they are,"" while adding ""This will be a Rigged Election. No way!"" In the same Twitter thread, Trump repeated his allegation that voting by mail ""is substantially fraudulent,"" a claim election experts have said is overblown. Here’s Trump’s full statement: ""There is NO WAY (ZERO!) that Mail-In Ballots will be anything less than substantially fraudulent. Mail boxes will be robbed, ballots will be forged & even illegally printed out & fraudulently signed. The Governor of California is sending Ballots to millions of people, anyone..... ....living in the state, no matter who they are or how they got there, will get one. That will be followed up with professionals telling all of these people, many of whom have never even thought of voting before, how, and for whom, to vote. This will be a Rigged Election. No way!"" Trump repeated his claim during a news conference Tuesday afternoon, saying ""anybody that walks in California is going to get a ballot."" Trump’s attacks come two days after the California Republican Party, along with national GOP groups, filed a federal lawsuit against Newsom, a Democrat, to halt his plan to send mail-in ballots to Californians ahead of the November election. Newsom earlier this month ordered all counties to send out mail-in ballots, citing health concerns amid COVID-19. Contrary to Trump’s claim, no ballots have yet been sent out. We zeroed in on Trump’s claim that ""anyone living in the state, no matter who they are"" would receive these ballots. We set out on a fact check. Our research A review of Newsom’s executive order shows only registered voters would receive vote-by-mail ballots, not ""anyone living in the state,"" as Trump claimed. ""Each county elections officials shall transmit vote-by-mail ballots for the November 3, 2020 General Election to all voters who are, as of the last day on which vote-by-mail ballots may be transmitted to voters in connection with that election, registered to vote in that election. As set forth in this paragraph, every Californian who is eligible to vote in the November 3, 2020 General Election shall receive a vote-by-mail ballot."" The Secretary of State’s website outlines criteria for registering to vote in California. You must be: A United States citizen and a resident of California, 18 years old or older on Election Day, Not currently in state or federal prison or on parole for the conviction of a felony Not currently found mentally incompetent to vote by a court This criteria reinforces the fact that not just ""anyone"" would receive a ballot. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for evidence supporting Trump’s statement. Newsom rejected the president’s assertion that voting by mail leads to fraud when asked about it during a press conference on Tuesday. The governor also cited several studies that have examined the practice and found an extremely low rate of fraud, including a 5-year effort by the Bush administration that turned up virtually no evidence of any organized effort to skew federal elections. ""I don’t think it deserves to be politicized. This is a health issue,"" Newsom added. A spokesperson for Secretary of State Alex Padilla, who is also a Democrat, also disputed the president’s assertion. ""Only active registered voters will be mailed a ballot ahead of the November 3, 2020 General Election. The President’s tweet is completely false,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email. Voters are considered ""inactive"" if they do not vote in two consecutive federal general elections or if their county receives a returned residency confirmation without a forwarding address within the same county, according to the Secretary of State’s website. Trump’s claim led Twitter, for the first time on Tuesday, to place a fact-checking warning on the president’s tweet. A spokesperson for Twitter told NPR the tweet contains ""misleading information about the voting process, specifically mail-in ballots."" Padilla has pushed back against Trump’s past claims about vote-by-mail. On Twitter on Sunday, Padilla responded to the GOP lawsuit this way: ""Expanding vote-by-mail during a pandemic is not a partisan issue — it’s a moral imperative to protect voting rights and public safety. Vote-by-mail has been used safely and effectively in red, blue, and purple states for years. This lawsuit is just another part of Trump’s political smear campaign against voting by mail. We will not let this virus be exploited for voter suppression."" Some Republicans have cited issues of voter roll maintenance as evidence of fraud. President Trump, for example, has falsely cited a January 2019 settlement California reached with the conservative group Judicial Watch as evidence. On ""Meet the Press"" last year, Trump alleged the settlement shows California ""admitted"" there were ""a million"" illegal votes in the 2016 presidential election. We rated that claim Pants On Fire. In reality, the agreement Trump cited required Los Angeles County election officials to remove inactive registrations from voter rolls to comply with federal law. The 20-page settlement document, however, notes all parties agreed there was no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the state or county. It makes no mention of voter fraud or illegal voting. During the 2016 campaign, Trump distorted the findings in a 2012 Pew study to allege widespread voter fraud was taking place. The national study found 24 million voter registrations were ""no longer valid or significantly inaccurate."" More than 1.8 million dead people were listed as voters, the report said, and 2.75 million people were registered to vote in more than one state. Trump has used that study to allege ""dead people"" are voting. But an analysis of the study by FactCheck.org shows ""The report did not allege the 1.8 million deceased people actually voted. Rather, Pew said that it is evidence of the need to upgrade voter registration systems."" Our rating President Trump claimed California Gov. Gavin Newsom ""is sending millions of ballots to anyone living in the state, no matter who they are,"" while adding ""This will be a Rigged Election. No way!"" In reality, Newsom ordered counties to send mail-in ballots only to registered voters in California, hardly to ""anyone living in the state."" To register to vote in California, residents must be 18, U.S. citizens, not in state or federal prison or on parole for the conviction of a felony, and not declared mentally incompetent to vote by a court. When combined with the misleading allegation that mail-in voting leads to fraud (something election experts say is exceedingly rare), and Trump’s assertion that California’s election will be ""Rigged,"" the president’s overall claim is reckless, unsubstantiated and wrong.

Instead, they extended it to 2020. Some blame this move for sealing the fate of the failed bid to raise taxes to fund a transportation overhaul for metro Atlanta.Deal, then vying for the governor’s seat, seized on the issue. He promised voters he’d tear down the toll by the end of 2011.The tollbooths still stand, but now Deal’s recent announcement that the toll will come down during his term has him crowing that he kept his campaign pledge.""Fulfilling his promise to commuters, Gov.

They’ve carried more than their fair share.""Deal’s resolve waned in the coming months.By the time Deal took office in January 2011, the State Road and Tollway Authority Board had already sold $40 million in bonds based on the revenue expected from the newly extended toll.Ending the toll ""would be an abrogation of a contract,"" the governor’s spokesman, Brian Robinson, told PolitiFact Georgia in 2011.Robinson did not return repeated requests for comment on this article.The feud over the Ga. 400 toll became a flash point during the run-up to Tuesday’s unsuccessful referendum on a regional penny-per-dollar sales tax to overhaul metro Atlanta’s traffic-snarled transportation system.Deal backed the tax, which would have expired in 10 years or less.But tax foes said that the Ga. 400 flap was proof that the government couldn’t be trusted with transportation dollars.Polls showed the tax measure flagging in the polls. Twelve days before the election, Deal announced that the state would pay off the $40 million in new bonds by Dec. 1, 2013. The tollbooths would come down soon afterward.""When the Ga. 400 toll went up, the state of Georgia promised commuters that it wasn’t forever,"" his recent news release said.

Let us fact-check the claim made in the post. Claim: 650 died in the USA because of a disease that spread due to eating onions. Fact: A recent salmonella outbreak linked to onions was reported in the United States but there were no deaths reported because of this outbreak. According to the figures posted by the CDC on 29 October 2021, there were 808 illnesses and 157 hospitalizations, and no deaths reported. The FDA, along with CDC and state and local partners, is investigating a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Oranienburg infections linked to whole, fresh onions. Onions linked to the outbreak are being recalled for possible contamination. Hence, the claim made in the post is Misleading. Upon opening the link given in the post, an article with the headline that says 650 people have died in a hospital is found. However, if one reads the full article, nowhere it has been mentioned that so many people have died, except in the headline. In fact, the first paragraph in the article says that no one had died yet. “In the US, more than 650 people in 37 states were sickened by an outbreak of salmonella bacteria caused by onions. The US Centers For Disease Control and Prevention said that about 129 people are currently hospitalised, and no one has died so far.” On 20 October 2021, the CDC had released a media statement about a ‘Food Safety Alert’. According to the CDC, there was a multistate outbreak of Salmonella Oranienburg infections in the United States, where whole onions were identified as the source of the outbreak. The CDC had advised people not to eat certain types of onions. “CDC advises people who have unlabelled whole red, white, or yellow onions at home to throw them away and not eat them. People should not eat, and businesses should not sell or serve, whole onions that were imported from Chihuahua, Mexico, and distributed by ProSource Inc.” No deaths have been reported in relation to the outbreak; 652 people had been reported sick but only 129 had been hospitalized. According to the latest figures posted on 29 October 2021 by the CDC, there were 808 illnesses and 157 hospitalizations. Still, there were no deaths reported. The US Food & Drug Administration (FDA), along with the CDC, is investigating this outbreak linked to whole, fresh onions. “FDA’s traceback investigation is ongoing but has identified ProSource Produce, LLC (also known as ProSource Inc.) of Hailey, Idaho, and Keeler Family Farms of Deming, New Mexico, as suppliers of potentially contaminated whole, fresh onions imported from the State of Chihuahua, Mexico.” Onions linked to the outbreak are being recalled for possible contamination. To sum it up, the Salmonella outbreak in the US is linked to onions but there is no evidence that 650 people died because of the outbreak recently.",False,False
152,"[Claim]:Hiroshima and Nagasaki hit by nuclear bombs in 1945, radiation dissipated[Evidences]:The Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were targets of the first “atomic” bombs ever used in war, which killed tens of thousands through radiation exposure, but the absence of excess radiation in those cities decades later does not mean the explosions never occurred, as claimed by an online video. A Facebook video with the text “Hiroshima and Nagasaki were never nuked” points to the fact that the two cities are thriving today and asserts that lingering radiation should have made them uninhabitable for centuries (here). However, most of the radiation released in the mid-air blasts in 1945 never made it to the ground, according to scientists, and what did was mostly short-lived, decaying not long after the explosions. The post suggesting that the two Japanese cities were never bombed surfaced in August 2023 around the 78th anniversary of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings and the release of the film “Oppenheimer”, which tells the story of the bombs’ creation (here). On Aug. 6, 1945, the U.S. released a 10,000-pound bomb made with uranium-235 above the city of Hiroshima, Japan, which had a population of 350,000. Instantly, 78,000 people were killed, a number that increased to 140,000 by the end of 1945, Reuters has reported, citing the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (here). Three days later, on Aug. 9, 1945, the U.S. dropped a 10,000-pound bomb made from plutonium-239 over the city of Nagasaki, with 200,000 inhabitants, instantly killing 27,000. Deaths increased to about 70,000 by the end of the year due to acute radiation exposure. Both bombs were designed to detonate thousands of feet above the ground, leveling buildings for miles with the force of the explosion itself and the resulting fires. But the intense radiation released by the blasts caused the majority of immediate deaths through radiation burns and radiation poisoning, according to the Radiation Effects Research Foundation (RERF), a U.S.-Japanese research organization focused on studying long-term health effects in survivors of the 1945 blasts (www.rerf.or.jp/en/faq/). Because of the altitude of the detonations, most of the radiation from the explosions did not even reach the ground in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Jeffrey Hart, RERF’s chief of public relations and publications, said in an email. “Because the burst heights of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were at 600 meters in the air and 503 meters, respectively, most of the radiation (90%) was pulled up into the atmosphere,” Hart said. The circulating video states, “Plutonium 239 has a half-life of 24,110 years and uranium 235 has a half-life of 703 million years, in theory making both Hiroshima and Nagasaki uninhabitable for thousands of years,” however, this misrepresents the nature of radioactive decay, according to Derek Haas, an associate professor in the Nuclear and Radiation Engineering Program at the University of Texas at Austin. “Rate of decay is inversely proportional to half life, so something with a long half life, it’s not very radioactive,” Haas said in a phone interview. Emphasizing the distinction between the radiation released by the blasts themselves, and radioactive materials that would have fallen to the ground and contaminated the area, Haas said that what reached the ground would have included “a mix of fission products and some leftover material from the bomb itself.” The isotopes that would have caused the most harm include iodine 131, which has a short half life and is very dangerous, he said. “But the most dangerous ones would have decayed with hours.” “If you look at all the radioactivity at one day, it’s decayed by factor of 100,000; at 10 days by a factor of 1 million; at 10 years, it’s gone down by a factor of 1 billion.” Today, the city of Hiroshima explains on its website, the city’s level of radiation is “on a par with the extremely low levels of background radiation (natural radioactivity) present anywhere on Earth” and has no effect on humans (here). The most enduring evidence of the 1945 nuclear explosions in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is the testimonials of survivors (time.com/after-the-bomb/) and (here) and their well-documented health effects due to the blasts. The RERF Life Span Study (here) of long-term health effects has followed 120,000 residents since 1950, including 94,000 blast survivors and 27,000 unexposed people. RERF says that an excess risk of leukemia was highest during the first 10 years after the explosions and was especially seen in those who were exposed to the radiation as children. Beyond cancer, the risk of uterine myoma (fibroids), chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis, thyroid disease, and cardiovascular disease also increased in survivors in another RERF study that looked at 20,000 people from the Life Span Study followed since 1958, with an additional 3,400 participants whose mothers were pregnant at the time of the blasts added in 1977 (here). In survivors exposed to the explosions as fetuses, researchers also found “a reduction in IQ with increased radiation dose, a higher incidence of mental disability in those heavily exposed, and impairment in physical growth and development.” As of 2014, about 29% of the RERF study population was still living, and more than 77% of the survivors exposed under the age of 10 were still living, according to the RERF website (www.rerf.or.jp/en/faq/).

Gov. Dan Patrick told Austin radio station KLBJ AM. In the Feb. 25, 2015 interview, which we caught online, Patrick said: ""We are in the best financial shape of any state in the country. We’ll have about $11 billion or so in our rainy day fund by the end of our fiscal year. That’s more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined."" This fiscal year runs through August 2015. Could it be that Texas will have more money in its rainy day fund than all other states combined? We emailed Patrick’s office to seek the basis of his statement and to gauge if he was trying to make an uncheckable prediction—rather than a flat factual statement. We also looked for the latest information on each state’s expected fiscal-year-end reserves. The Texas state comptroller, Glenn Hegar, issued his two-year state revenue forecast in January 2015. Hegar said the state’s rainy day fund will have a balance of nearly $8.5 billion when fiscal 2015 ends Aug. 31, 2015. Hegar projected the fund to grow to $9.8 billion a year later and to $11 billion through August 2017. Per Patrick’s statement, then, all the other states together should be expecting to end their 2015 fiscal years with less than $8.5 billion, combined. Texas, Alaska outpace other states An online search led us to a fall 2014 report by the National Association of State Budget Officers initially making us think Patrick was onto something. In the report, The Fiscal Survey of States, a section headlined ""Year-End Balances"" said that generally, states have made progress rebuilding budgetary reserves since revenues plummeted during the Great Recession of 2009-10. State budgets passed into law for the 2015 fiscal year show reserve balances nationally totaling $53.1 billion, the report said. And, the report said, ""a disproportionate share of state budget reserves are concentrated in Alaska and Texas, which account for $20.6 billion or 38.8 percent of states reported total balances in fiscal 2015."" Pew official For more perspective, we sought guidance from the Pew Charitable Trusts, which in July 2014 issued a report on how states might build rainy day funds. By email, spokeswoman Sarah Leiseca passed along analyst Brenna Erford’s conclusion--drawing on Fiscal 50, a Pew interactive breaking out the fiscal status of each state--that Patrick got it wrong. At the moment, per Pew, Texas has $10.3 billion in reserve funds (rainy day funds plus ending balances) providing enough for state government to operate for 79.1 days. ""The only state with more reserve funds currently is Alaska, with $13.3 billion, providing enough for the state to operate for 181.9 days,"" Erford said. SOURCE: Online interactive, Fiscal 50, Pew Charitable Trusts (chart received in an email from Sarah Leiseca, communications officer, Pew Charitable Trusts, attributing information to research by Brenna Erford, manager, state budget policy team, Pew Charitable Trusts, Feb. 26, 2015). Going forward, Erford noted, the NASBO fall 2014 report indicates Texas projecting a reserve balance of about $8 billion through the end of the 2015 fiscal year, which would run second to the projected year-end reserves for Alaska, $11.4 billion. ""According to these data, the sum total of reserves in California, New York, Ohio, Massachusetts, Florida, and Indiana, is greater than Texas’ reserves, providing clear evidence, Alaska withstanding, that Texas’ reserves are not more ‘than the other 49 states combined,’"" Erford said. NASBO charts With a nudge from Michael Leachman, a state budget expert at the Washington, D.C.-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, we spotted charts in the NASBO report indicating the 50 states together in fall 2014 were projecting 2015 fiscal-year-end reserves, meaning regular balances plus rainy day fund set-asides, of about $53 billion--with Texas accounting for $10.7 billion of that and Alaska $10 billion and other states all together projecting nearly $32 billion in ending reserves. An adjoining chart indicates Texas ending fiscal 2015 with $8 billion in its rainy day fund alone compared to other states together winding up with about $34 billion in such funds. Texas appears to have bigger balances than many states. But its predicted totals don’t dwarf all other states’ projected savings combined. Patrick: ‘Unintentional error’ After we looked over the charts, Patrick’s office told us Patrick made ""an unintentional error"" in the radio interview. By email, spokesman Alejandro Garcia said Patrick takes pride in the state stockpiling reserves, but he’d meant to talk up jobs created in Texas versus jobs created in all other states combined ""as he ad-libbed the comment."" Our ruling Patrick said Texas this year will ""have more money in reserve than the other 49 states combined."" On our inquiry, Patrick acknowledged this was a misstatement. Indeed, what he celebrated turned out to be incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

154,"[Claim]:""In Austin, I’ve got half-a-dozen or more schools on a list to be closed — one of which I presented a federal blue-ribbon award to for excellence. And several hundred school personnel on the list for possible terminations.""[Evidences]:U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett landed in a Feb. 16 opinion column by Gail Collins of The New York Times that questioned draft plans by the GOP-led Texas Legislature not to hike state education aid.""In Austin,"" Collins quoted the Austin Democrat saying, ""I’ve got half-a-dozen or more schools on a list to be closed — one of which I presented a federal blue-ribbon award to for excellence. And several hundred school personnel on the list for possible terminations.""We wondered if Doggett accurately summarized the situation.Doggett’s spokeswoman, Sarah Dohl, told us by e-mail that Doggett based his comment on Austin American-Statesman news reports on a district task force’s recommendations about closing schools and the district’s recent announcement that it’s considering employee layoffs as part of an array of budget cuts.Doggett’s ""blue-ribbon"" reference, Dohl said, was to South Austin’s Zilker Elementary. We found a May 1999 Statesman story stating that Zilker was among three district schools that year to win the honor from the U.S. Department of Education. The story says Doggett was expected to attend the award ceremony. It quotes then-Education Secretary Richard Riley saying: ""These schools are examples of the good things happening in education nationwide.""Next, we turned to the Statesman’s coverage of school closure recommendations by the Austin district’s volunteer facilities task force. According to a Feb. 10 story, the task force in January specified nine schools, including Zilker, that could be closed ""for efficiency’s sake."" However, the story says, the task force’s recommendations to the school board would not name particular schools, instead referring to areas of the city where schools could be closed in 2012-13 and 2013-14.A link on the Statesman site led us to a Feb. 9 draft version of the task force’s district facility master plan, which urges consideration of school closures ""only after all other alternatives and options, both programmatic and facilities use, have been thoroughly examined and discussed with the affected communities.""No individual schools are named, but there are regional suggestions for consolidating/closing a middle school in Northeast Austin; four elementary schools in ""Central East Austin""; three elementary schools in Central Austin; and one elementary school in South Austin.We called the district, whose spokesman, Andy Welch, cautioned that the district has no school-closing schedule and said its facility task force won’t present its final report until March. ""So there is no list"" of schools to be closed, Welch said.Still, didn’t the names of nine schools get floated for possibly closing? ""Can’t deny that,"" Welch said.After he noted that some of the school district is outside Doggett’s House district, we ran the addresses of the schools named for possible closure through the Texas Legislative Council’s ""Who Represents Me?"" web feature. Eight are in Doggett’s district; Pease Elementary is in San Antonio Rep. Lamar Smith’s district.Dohl of Doggett’s office said by e-mail that the congressman was aware of the updated task force report--and that it doesn’t specify individual schools to possibly close. But, Dohl said, ""the school closure list seems to still be a very real issue"" and Doggett believes school closures should be avoided.All told, Doggett’s comment accurately refers to Zilker Elementary and possible district layoffs. At the time he spoke, though, the task force that aired school closing suggestions had backed off the specifics. And it's not certain any schools are to be closed. We rate Doggett’s statement Mostly True.",True,True

It followed an attempt by an opposition party to introduce a motion of no confidence against Zuma.Radebe listed a number of achievements he attributed to the Zuma and the government. “This is not a political stunt,"" he wrote, ""this is no fiction; this is reality.""Are his statements based on reality? Africa Check assessed them.(Note: Radebe’s office failed to respond to several requests for the source material on which he based his claims. A government spokesperson, Phumla Williams, also ignored calls and text messages. We have evaluated the claims by drawing on publicly available data and information.)VotingClaim “In 2014, more than 62% of South Africans made their democratic choice to choose a political party of their choice.” Verdict incorrectEconomic growthClaim “By the fourth quarter of 2014, GDP showed signs of recovery at a 4.1%. What is important, though, is that the real sectors of the economy, namely agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, were positive and actually grew.” Verdict misleadingEmploymentClaim “Whilst jobs were lost [due to the recession], in 2014 South Africa has actually managed to employ even more people than were employed in the years when jobs were lost, implying that there is recovery.” Verdict misleadingRenewable energyClaim “Under the stewardship of President Zuma, South Africa has one of the largest renewable energy programmes ranked among the top 10 in the world.” Verdict incorrectElectricityClaim “The percentage of households connected to the electricity mains increased from 82% to 85%.” Verdict correctWaterClaim “The percentage of households connected to piped water increased from 88% to 90%.” Verdict mostly-correctSanitationClaim “The percentage of households with access to RDP standard sanitation increased from 70% to 78%.” Verdict mostly-correctEducationClaim “The percentage of persons aged 20 years and above with no formal education or highest level of education less than Grade 7 within each gender group decreased from 19.3% to 16.2%.” Verdict correctLife expectancyClaim “South Africans now live nine years longer than they did in 2005 due to the roll-out by this government of drugs that prolong life.” Verdict correctStudent aidClaim “[The] National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) increased from R2.4 billion in 2008 to R9.5 billion in 2014.” Verdict mostly-correctPovertyClaim “South Africans benefit from a cocktail of social assistance programmes and services that alleviate poverty and indeed poverty has visibly been reduced since 2000.” Verdict correctState spendingClaim “South Africans have continued to trust government with their taxes. South Africa’s budget in 1994 was R135.1-billion; by 2004 this had doubled to R370-billion and R834-billion in 2009. The Minister of Finance recently announced a budget of R1.3-trillion. This means that since 2009 we have added more than the equivalent of the entire budget of 2004 and seen a 1,000% increase since 1994.” Verdict incorrectSouth Africa had a population of around 54-million people in 2014. According to the Independent Electoral Commission , an estimated 31.4-million people were eligible to vote in 2014 but only about 18.4-million people turned up to vote. The ANC garnered 11.4-million votes This means that 21% of all South Africans, or 36% of all eligible voters, voted for the ANC. Sixty two percent of all valid votes cast were for the African National Congress.Radebe is right on the numbers, but the financial quarter he chose to highlight paints a much brighter economic picture than is actually the case.The deputy governor of the South African Reserve Bank, Francois Groepe, made the distinction in a recent address : “Although the South African economy expanded at a brisk annualised rate of 4.1% in the final quarter of 2014, growth for the full year was a disappointing 1.5% and represents the second-lowest growth rate recorded over the past sixteen years.” If you look at 2014 as a whole , the mining sector actually contracted by 1.6%, while the manufacturing industry showed no growth. Agriculture did increase by 5.6% percent.Radebe’s claim only deals with absolute labour statistics, that is, the actual number of people employed. In the fourth quarter of 2008 there were approximately 14.7-million people employed in the South African economy. By the third quarter of 2010 1.1-million jobs had been lost.Since then employment has increased. The most recent employment statistics show that 15.3-million people were employed in the fourth quarter of 2014 However, Radebe’s claim is misleading in that the unemployment rate has not recovered to pre-recession levels. Ratios are a better measure than absolute figures, the executive manager of labour statistics at Stats SA, Peter Buwembo, has told Africa Check.Prior to the recession the narrow unemployment rate was 21.5%. The latest statistics show the unemployment rate was 24.3% at the end of 2014.According to Kadri Nassiep, CEO of the state-owned South African National Energy Development Institute , “countries such as China, US and Germany still lead the way in total installed capacity”.He added that South Africa falls in the top 5 countries when the size of its renewable energy investment is compared to GDP. Uruguay, Mauritius and Costa Rica topped this ranking in the 2014 Global Status Report, compiled by international renewable network REN21.South Africa did make the top 10 list for investment in renewable energy in 2012 and 2013. The two most recent reports by Bloomberg New Energy Finance stated that South Africa invested $5.7-billion in renewable energy in 2012 and $4.9-billion in 2013 China was head and shoulders above the rest: investing $64.7-billion and $54.2-billion in those years. It already has an installed renewable energy capacity of 378GW , whereas South Africa aims for 6.7GW by 2016 and 17.8GW by 2030 The 2013 General Household Survey reported that the percentage of households connect to electricity mains increased from 82.7% in 2009 to 85.4% in 2013. The statistics for 2014 will be released around the middle of this year.The 2013 General Household Survey revealed that 89.9% of households had access to piped water, up from 89% when Zuma took office. Just over 4% of households had to fetch water from rivers, streams, stagnant water pools and dams, wells and springs.But this one statistic does not provide the full picture about access to water in South Africa. In 2013 a quarter of households reported interruptions to their water supply that lasted more than 2 days at a time or lasted more than 15 days in total.Households also reported problems with the quality of water they received. In 2013 7.4% households (1.1-million) felt that their water was not safe to drink, 7.9% that their water was not clear, 8.8% that their water did not taste good whereas just over a million households (6.9%) felt that their water was not free from bad smells.The 2013 General Household Survey showed that access to RDP standard sanitation increased from 72.4% of households in 2009 to 77.9% of households in 2013. RDP standard sanitation includes flush toilets (either connected to a public sewerage system or a septic tank) or a pit toilet with a ventilation pipe.In 2013 62% percent of households had access to a flush toilet connected to either the public sewerage system or a septic tank. 15% has access to a pit latrine with a ventilation pipe and 16% has access to a pit latrine without a ventilation pipe.Four percent of households reported that they did not have access to sanitation of any kind. The survey noted that “the percentage of households that continued to live without proper sanitation facilities had been declining consistently between 2002 and 2013”.However, the general secretary of the Cape Town based Social Justice Coalition, Phumeza Mlungwana, told Africa Check that Radebe’s numbers lacked important context.“The claim doesn’t say anything about the condition of the toilet or the experience of using it or whether the toilet is functional and clean,” she said.For the first time, the 2013 General Household Survey included questions about problems experienced by households that share sanitation facilities. Statistics provided by Stats SA showed that 3,209,048 households (22.4%) reported sharing toilets facilities.The main problems these households experienced included poor hygiene (25.6%), poor lighting (25.1%), concern about physical safety while using the toilets (22%) and finding the toilet pit or chamber full (21.8%).The 2013 General Household Survey reported that the percentage of people aged 20 years and older who had no education, or had completed some primary school below grade 7, had decreased from 19.3% in 2009 to 16.2% in 2013.Radebe’s claim is supported by Stats SA’s 2014 mid-year population estimates . It showed that life expectancy increased by 9.1 years from 52.1 in 2005 to 61.2 years in 2014.Deputy executive director at the Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute , Francois Venter, told Africa Check that the general consensus was that life expectancy in South Africa had been driven up by the rollout of antiretroviral therapy.“If you stop someone from dying in their 20s, 30s and 40s with ARVs, you bump up the average age at death significantly,” he said.“It is possible other things contributed – fresh water, less under-nutrition, expanded vaccine programmes – but that doesn’t cause such a dramatic change.”The National Student Financial Aid Scheme’s annual reports show that they provided funding worth R2.5-billion in 2008/09 A spokesman for the National Student Financial Aid Scheme, Kagisho Mamabolo, told Africa Check that R9.2-billion worth of funding was provided in 2014. However, this excluded an additional R1-billion which was provided by the Department of Higher Education and Training to cover funding shortfalls in 2013 and 2014.The scheme provides funding to students that qualify according to a financial means test . Students are required to start repaying their loans once they start earning a salary of R30,000 or more per year, at an initial rate of 3% of their annual salary.Both students and universities have raised concerns that there is not enough funding to assist financially needy students. Earlier this year Wits University’s Student Representative Council was reported to have raised R2-million to assist students that did not receive funding from the scheme.Research by the Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit at the University of Cape Town, among others, showed that poverty as measured by income declined slightly between 1993 and 2012.To a large degree, the decline could be attributed to state spending on social grants, said Lauren Royston, director of research and capacity at the Socio-Economic Rights Institute (SERI).Another tool whereby poverty can be measured showed an even greater reduction over this period . The Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) takes into account more than income. It scores nine factors, such as school enrolment, nutritional levels and access to basic services that include electricity, sanitation and water.However, the index suffers from two limitations, former SERI researcher Michael Clark pointed out. First, it relies heavily on government statistics. The index also does not measure the quality of basic services.Despite the decrease achieved, Royston said South Africans must be mindful that poverty remains deep and widespread and that inequality has increased This claim is a bit nonsensical as it neither proves nor confirms anything, said the head of Wits University’s School of Economic and Business Sciences, Professor Jannie Rossouw. “One, we are compelled to pay taxes and two, to judge the budget in nominal terms doesn’t tell us much.”Rossouw said a more useful metric is to compare the budget with the gross national product (GDP) in a particular year. South Africa’s budget comprised 28.9% of GDP in the 1992/93 financial year , the highest this ratio was from 1993 to 2012. Between 2004/05 and 2011/12 it averaged 27.2%. In 2013 the ratio reached 33.2% There is a cause for concern when state expenditure grows faster than the economy, said Rossouw, as he has pointed out as co-author of a journal article before . However, state expenditure slowed in the fourth quarter of last year , giving some credence to the state’s promise to curb spending.",Conflicting,True
156,"[Claim]:Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg said that the age of consent must be lowered to age 12 years old[Evidences]:Fake Quotes Did Ruth Bader Ginsberg say the age of consent for sexual acts must be lowered to age 12 years old? No, that is not true. The Supreme Court justice did not ever say this. The claims have gone viral with fake quotes from Ginsberg. They were inaccurately attributed to a paper she co-authored in 1974 in which she was arguing for gender-neutral terms to be used in the penal code for rape cases. The claim appeared as a post (archived here) published on Facebook on July 24, 2020. It opened: The age of consent must be lowered to age 12 years old. Ruth Traitor Ginsberg 1977 This is what the post looked like on Facebook at the time of writing: (Source: Facebook screenshot taken on Wed Aug 5 16:43:08 2020 UTC) In the paper she co-authored in 1974, Ginsberg was quoting a proposed 1973 Senate bill that, she said, properly used gender-neutral terms in the definition of rape, which included rape against a person that was ""less than 12 years old."" She was not advocating to lower the age of consent and the terminology in the claim was not hers. Here is another claim against Ginsberg saying she said ""Pedophilia is good for the children."" There is no evidence she ever said that, either: The accusations that have gone viral against Ginsberg began during her 1993 Senate confirmation hearing after President Bill Clinton nominated her to the Supreme Court. Susan Hirschmann, executive director of Eagle Forum, a conservative group founded by Phyllis Schlafly, testified to the Senate Committee on July 23, 1993, claiming that Ginsberg wanted to lower the age of consent to 12. Here is a link to the transcript from Hirschmann's testimony. The 1974 report Ginsberg co-authored, titled ""Sex Bias in the U.S. Code,"" was published by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in 1977. In it she was arguing that there was a gender bias in the United States penal code and for equality purposes laws should use a gender-neutral terms to recognize either male and female victims of crimes. She quoted the proposed 1973 Senate bill, S. 1400, in §1631 (which never became law) with a definition of rape. She argued in her report that gender-neutral terms should be used so that both males and females were recognized as victims under the law and cited this particular proposed bill as one that did use gender-neutral terms appropriately. This is the terminology from the bill, the highlighted part showing the 12 year old reference: A person is guilty of an offense if he engages in a sexual act with another person, not his spouse, and (1) compels the other person to participate: (A) by force or (B) by threatening or placing the other person in fear that any person will imminently be subjected to death, serious bodily injury, or kidnapping; (2) has substantially impaired the other person's power to appraise or control the conduct by administering or employing a drug or intoxicant without the knowledge or against the will of such other person, or by other means; or (3) the other person is, in fact, less than 12 years old."" Ginsberg was not writing about the age of consent. Snopes.com also debunked the claims against Ginsberg and published the portion of her report where she referred to the bill and wrote it ""conforms to the equality principle,"" which you can see here. The claims against her have been repeated for decades. During John Roberts' confirmation hearing in 2005, Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., accused Ginsberg of wanting to lower the age of consent, according to an article published on Slate in 2005. Here is a link to the Washington Post transcript of the hearing, including what Graham said with a fuller transcript excerpt below: Well, there are all kind of hearts. There are bleeding hearts and there are hard hearts. And if I wanted to judge Justice Ginsburg on her heart, I might take a hard-hearted view of her and say she's a bleeding heart. She represents the ACLU. She wants the age of consent to be 12. She believes there's a constitutional right to prostitution. What kind of heart is that?"" Many of the memes have cited an article titled, ""SUPREME SWAMP JUSTICE: RUTH BADER SUPPORTS PEDOPHILIA?"" published in 2018 on Fulcrum News. Here is the mention of pedophilia in the article: This past Sunday, after Qanon claims Ruth is not 'Here to Stay,' many issues have resurfaced; including previous works indicating her pro-pedophilia stance.""

157,"[Claim]:A woman named Anna wore a necklace for two years without knowing that her boyfriend, Terry, had hidden an engagement ring inside it.[Evidences]:It was a beautiful love story. A woodworker named Terry gave his girlfriend, Ana, a special necklace that he crafted himself. More than a year after Ana started wearing the necklace, the pair visited Smoo Cave in the Scottish Highlands, and it was at this moment in November 2016 that Terry revealed to Ana an engagement ring was hidden in a compartment in the necklace. As Terry proposed to her, Ana knew he had been planning to go down on one knee all along. She said “yes.” This was a true story that involved real people named Terry and Ana: an engagement ring really was hidden inside a necklace that Ana wore for more than a year. (The pair’s last names did not appear in news stories after they requested them to be omitted “because of media attention.”) Unfortunately, in late 2020 the tale was seized upon by viral content websites such as FactAhead.com. The website’s creators published a 43-page slideshow which forced readers to click “next page” more than 42 times to read the whole story. The site not only twisted the truth behind the couple’s tale but also spent money to advertise the misleading article online in late 2020 and early 2021. The ads were hosted by the Taboola advertising platform, which we observed appearing on numerous websites: The strategy behind making a single story take 43 pages to read through is known as advertising “arbitrage.” The idea is to bring in more money through ads displayed on each of the 43 pages than it cost to run the initial advertisement that lured readers to the article in the first place. The misleading version of the story claimed that Ana wore the necklace for two years before Terry showed her what was inside of it, but Ana only wore the necklace for a bit more than a year before the big reveal. Viral-content websites also made baseless claims about the couple’s finances, as well as about Ana’s purportedly having a fear of flying. One page of the slideshow story identified a photograph as showing one of Ana’s friends (“Below a photo of Ana’s friend Sofia”), but the picture was merely a stock photograph. The truthful story about Terry and Ana was covered by credible news organizations in 2017. The BBC, for example, reported the following about the materials Terry used to create the necklace: Terry made the necklace from Tasmanian Huon pine and the inside of a seashell. It was hollow inside and this was where the ring was hidden. He gave the necklace to Anna [sic] as a gift to mark the first anniversary of their relationship. Terry said: “She wore it every day and everywhere we went, and pretty much never took it off.” ABC News also reported that Ana wore the necklace for “more than a year”: Still, she had no idea what was really inside until more than a year later. The travel-loving couple decided to trek to Smoo Cave, located in Durness, Scotland, in April. That’s when Terry finally decided to tell Anna [sic] what had been hidden in her beloved necklace. “Before we actually went down to the cave, I asked if I could have the necklace to take some photos of it among the rocks, which gave me a quick chance to break the seal with a knife,” he detailed. And when Terry went to return the necklace to Anna [sic], he opened it to reveal the engagement ring inside. His now-fiancée replied, “Wait … it’s been in there the entire time?” And of course, later she said yes to Terry’s marriage proposal. The “Hidden inside the Necklace” YouTube video created by Terry and Ana has been viewed more than 5 million times: In December 2020, Terry himself addressed the misleading version promoted by viral content websites: Hello all. If you are finding this video now (Nov/Dec 2020) because you got click-baited into reading a long article that was poorly written and full of ads – Sorry. That article has been published without contacting us, and is full of outright lies and extreme uses of “artistic license.” There are heaps of other SHORT articles that are actually legit from 2017/2018. Anyway, sorry, I hope you didn’t waste any ‘important’ time reading it. The couple also said that the websites “really really stretched the truth, and flat out made up some stuff.” Despite BBC, ABC News, and other news organizations’ publishing the woman’s name as “Anna,” we confirmed it was spelled Ana, not Anna. Also, BBC reported that the proposal took place in November 2016, while ABC News published that it occurred in April 2017. In fact, the video about the event was uploaded to YouTube in April 2017, but the proposal had happened months earlier, in November 2016. This dating was confirmed by People.com, who assigned a reporter to speak with the couple. Additional tidbits about the story could be found in the comments for the YouTube video. For example, Terry said he made Ana another necklace since he wasn’t able to properly put the original one back together. He also noted that the new one was empty. Terry observed that he was “paranoid” about Ana’s learning of the hidden engagement ring compartment in the original necklace. He was so afraid she’d find out about his plan that he didn’t take a picture of that part of the process while he was creating the necklace: I was so paranoid about Ana finding photos of the ring being hidden in there on my computer/phone/Google Photos, etc, etc, that I didn’t take a photo of that particular step. If you look at 0:04, you see a thin white line. I carved the spot for the ring and then glue the 2 pieces of wood together with a thin sheet of paper in between. The glue held it together and the paper acted as a weak point to split it apart later. I split it open once to test it, then I sealed the ring in there and finished it up. One YouTuber commented that “That necklace is really ugly tho,” to which Ana replied, “Perhaps not everyone’s taste, but he made it especially for me and I absolutely loved it :).” Editor’s Note: If Terry and Ana would like to correct any part of this story or to add anything, please contact us. Snopes debunks a wide range of content, and online advertisements are no exception. Misleading ads often lead to obscure websites that host lengthy slideshow articles with lots of pages.

The National Geographic has not featured the farmers' agitation as a cover story in any of its editions till now. The archived versions of the posts are saved here, here and here. The truth We looked thoroughly through the National Geographic website, but could not find any recent article or cover image highlighting the farmers' agitation in India. Rather, the recent editions of the magazine feature issues that are not even remotely related to the farmers' protests. Looking carefully, we found ""@anoopreet"" written at the right-hand bottom corner of the image. Searching through social media, we found the user's Instagram account.

159,"[Claim]:Image of three women walking behind a man in chains is digitally altered[Evidences]:Social media users have shared an image of three women wearing burkas and walking in chains behind a man, claiming that it shows Afghanistan in 2021. The image has been digitally altered and no chains are visible in the original photograph, which was taken in 2003. “God protect women and children because an institution like the United Nations has become impotent,” one user who shared the image on Twitter said (here). Other users on Facebook and Instagram claimed the image was current and compared it to an image of women wearing miniskirts, alleging that photograph dated from 1960 (here), (here), (here). The image is not recent and the chains were digitally added onto the original photograph. The earliest appearance of the image online is from a blog published in 2006 and no chains are present (archive.is/wip/fLZeF). The photography website credits Murat Düzyol, who told Reuters that he took the image in 2003. This (unedited) version was then shared on online blogs in 2011 and 2014 (archive.is/wip/0tYwX), (archive.is/wip/WS09N), (archive.is/chKb2), (archive.is/wip/9suej). There are further indications that the version with chains cuffed at the ankles is digitally altered. The shadows of the women are thin and angled, indicating that the image was likely taken at sunrise or sunset, when the sun is low-lying (here). The shadows of the chains between the man and woman behind him do not distort or lengthen – and thus don’t follow the same pattern as the other shadows in the image. Additionally, the size of the chain links does not change size or direction in the photo which has considerable depth, further suggesting that they were digitally added. Meanwhile, the image of the women walking down the street in miniskirts was not captured in 1960, as claimed in the viral memes. It was taken in Kabul in 1972 by photographer Laurence Brun (here). The doctored image emerged after the Taliban seized Afghanistan's capital on Sunday, following a week of rapid territorial gains from retreating government forces battling to hold off the Islamist militant group (here), (here). The United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed concern about the future of women and girls in the country on Sunday (here).",False,True
160,"[Claim]:""As governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent.""[Evidences]:Addiction is a deeply personal issue for Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, whose daughter Noelle suffered from addiction and a string of related criminal charges while he was serving as governor of Florida. In a Medium post on Jan. 5, 2016, Bush offered a glimpse into ""the heartbreak of drug abuse"" that his family had experienced, along with policy proposals to better address addiction. In the column, Bush discussed his record on drug policy during his gubernatorial tenure. ""As governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent,"" Bush wrote. Bush took office in January 1999 and left in January 2007. We took a closer look into that statistic. (A few days later, Bush turned Noelle's story into a television ad.) The Bush campaign pointed us to the 2006 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey conducted by the Florida Department of Children and Families. (Although several surveys of drug use are released on an annual basis, experts told us that this is the only survey that would speak to the specific numerical claim Bush made.) For heroin use, the survey offers two measurements -- heroin use at any time of one’s life, and heroin use during the past 30 days. For the first category -- use of heroin in one’s lifetime -- 2.2 percent of respondents between the ages of 11 and 18 had used it in 2000, compared to 1.1 percent in 2006. That’s a 50 percent decrease. And for the second category -- heroin use in the past 30 days -- 0.8 percent reported using it in 2000, compared to 0.4 percent in 2006. That’s also down by 50 percent. So numerically, Bush has a point. Still, experts said it’s worth taking those numbers with a grain of salt. Testing the numbers One concern is that the percentage of youth using heroin is small, meaning the differences from year to year are small -- and this makes them potentially unreliable. Indeed, the report itself cautions, ""Heroin use in a school population is extremely rare. Nationally, no lifetime prevalence rate for heroin has exceeded 2.4 percent in the 8th, 10th or 12th grades in the past decade. … Given the extremely low prevalence rates associated with heroin use by Florida students, analyses that attempt to precisely specify or quantify changes over time are subject to error."" In addition, for both measurements, the biggest drop came between 2000 and 2001, with minimal changes between 2002 and 2006. That seemed curious to Lloyd Johnston, a senior research scientist at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future study, which tracks drug use in the United States. ""While that is possible, I don't think it very plausible,"" Johnston said. ""Rates almost always change more gradually."" One possible explanation for that pattern, he said, is that the 2000 survey collected its data in December and January, whereas the 2001 to 2005 surveys conducted their data in April and May of those years. A further curiosity, Johnston said, is that one would not expect a one-year decline that steep for lifetime heroin use. From year to year, the pool of respondents is mostly the same. In the first year, the survey includes youth who are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years of age. The following year, the 18-year-olds drop out and a new group of 11-year-olds joins, but all the other groups are included again. With such modest changes from year to year in the makeup of the age groups, one would not expect a large change in heroin use over a lifetime from one year to the next, Johnston said. ""That makes the lifetime improvement in 2001 highly implausible,"" Johnston said, adding that a sizable change in the 30-day-rates would be more plausible. What was Bush’s role? There’s also a separate issue: Did Bush’s policies help engineer this decline? That’s hard to say, though drug-policy experts in Florida do praise Bush for his work on the issue. James Hall, a drug abuse epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University, said that Bush gave the issue high priority, including the creation of a drug policy office out of his own office to coordinate law enforcement, treatment, education and prevention. The office -- which was later eliminated by Gov. Rick Scott -- made a ""very significant contribution"" to drug policy in the state, Hall said. In addition, Bush championed community-based anti-drug coalitions that helped consolidate prevention efforts, Hall said. And his wife Columba was also active in drug- and alcohol-abuse issues, he added. Still, such efforts likely had a ""marginal influence"" on heroin-use rates, Hall said. Often, broader issues such as demographic and social trends have a bigger impact. Indeed, it’s worth noting that heroin use among youth was declining nationally during roughly the same period. Johnston’s own study found that heroin use among youth was declining nationally between 1999 and 2007, the full extent of Bush's term in office. ""For the three grades we study (eighth, 10th, and 12th), the combined prevalence of heroin use during the prior 12 months declined from 1.3 percent in 1999 to 0.8 percent in 2007,"" he said. That’s a drop of about 40 percent -- not far from what the Florida-only survey found. Our ruling Bush said that ""as governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent."" The only statistics that directly address his statement offer numeric support.However, the report in question cautions against drawing broad conclusions for such low-frequency events as youth heroin addiction, and experts thought it curious that the drop essentially happened in the first year, with little change after that. Experts praise Bush for his drug policies, but it’s important to note that broader demographic and social factors -- reflected in falling youth heroin use nationally during that period -- likely made a difference as well.

161,"[Claim]:""Only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian.""[Evidences]:Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee questioned the motives and origins of ""so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ "" during the Nov. 10 undercard GOP debate. While Huckabee, a former pastor, says he’s concerned about the plight of Christians in the region, he dismissed the idea of the United States accepting whoever —as he put it —wants free sandwiches and health care. ""We have no idea who these people are. What we do know is only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian,"" Huckabee said. ""Are we going to open the door so ISIS people can come on in, and we’ll give them a place to stay and a good sandwich and medical benefits?"" We were curious about Huckabee’s claim that the majority of the refugees don’t come from Syria. Huckabee’s spokesperson Hogan Gidley told us his source was the Eurostat, the European Union’s official statistical agency. He also forwarded us an article in the Daily Mail that said ""four out of five migrants are NOT from Syria."" (The article’s findings were repeated by some conservative American media outlets.) We found that the Daily Mail’s and Huckabee’s statistic represents the situation in the three months before the Syrian migrants actually began arriving in Europe in bulk. Looking at the whole picture, asylum seekers from Syria represent half of all refugees. According to the Daily Mail, the European Union ""logged 213,000 arrivals in April, May and June but only 44,000 of them were fleeing the Syrian civil war."" Those figures are lifted from Eurostat’s latest asylum quarterly report. But the Daily Mail’s use of data is flawed, and Huckabee’s extrapolation even more so. First, the four out of five non-Syrian migrants are not falsely claiming to be Syrian as Huckabee’s phrasing — ""so-called Syrian refugees"" — suggests. There is anecdotal evidence of people using fake or stolen passports, but the refugees in Eurostat’s tally hail from other countries that are experiencing or recovering from conflict, like Afghanistan, Albania, Iraq and Kosovo. The Guardianexplains why this distorts the refugee situation: ""If you lump this group in with those who crossed the Mediterranean to claim asylum, the number of Syrians will naturally seem smaller. But this is to conflate two largely separate phenomena: the Mediterranean crisis and internal migration between different European states."" (Huckabee’s point was that media reports conflated the the Syrian refugees and those who were not, Gidley told us.) And last and most importantly, the 44,000 figure only represents a three-month period. This is ""particularly problematic"" as the largest spike in Syrian arrivals occurred after June, pointed out the Guardian. Here’s a chart with data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ Syria page to that point: If we look at all of 2015, Syrian refugees account for 52 percent of nearly 800,000 Mediterranean sea arrivals, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Afghanistan and Iraq were the next two top countries of origin of refugees, accounting for 19 percent and 6 percent of refugees respectively. Our ruling Huckabee said, ""Only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian."" While the claim isn’t pulled out of thin air, it’s flawed. The statistic represents the three months before the actual influx of Syrian refugees, and the four out of five non-Syrians are not purporting to be Syrian. Rather, they came from war-torn countries. Overall, Syrian refugees account for half of all refugees arriving in Europe in 2015 so far. We rate Huckabee’s claim Mostly False.",Conflicting,Conflicting
162,"[Claim]:Says Hillary Clinton sold 20 percent of America’s uranium to Russia and then ""the Russian government gave $145 million to the Clinton Foundation."" Former FBI Director and special counsel Robert Mueller ""delivered it.""[Evidences]:A controversial tale involving Hillary Clinton, the Clinton Foundation, uranium and Russia continues to rear its ugly head years after it came out. We previously reportedon what we know about the Uranium One deal and to this day the details remain murky. The charge: That Hillary Clinton sold roughly 20 percent of America’s uranium supply to Russia in exchange for $145 million in donations to the Clinton Foundation. A recent social media post that takes the accusation a bit further by lumping in former FBI Director Robert Mueller, special counsel in the continuing special counsel investigation. The post has a picture of Hillary Clinton with text saying, ""I sold 20 percent of America’s uranium to Russia. Then the Russian government gave $145 million to Clinton Foundation."" Underneath is a picture of Mueller, with text saying, ""I delivered it."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As secretary of state, Clinton did serve on a government board that ultimately approved a transfer of uranium, but she wasn’t the deciding vote. And the Clinton Foundation did receive $145 million from parties involved in the transaction —but the dates of a large share of the donations and the deal don’t add up to suggest a quid pro quo. Mueller was the FBI director at the time, and the FBI was investigating corruption by the Russian company involved in the deal before the transfer was approved. But he played no role in delivering anything that we could find. The story stems back to the 2015 book Clinton Cash, an investigation by Breitbart News editor-at-large Peter Schweizer. A chapter in the book suggest a pay-for-play scheme between the Clintons and Russia, accusing them of transferring uranium in exchange for donation money. According to our previous story, in 2007, a Clinton Foundation donor, Frank Giustra, sold his company UrAsia, to another — Uranium One — and unloaded his personal stake in it. The merged company kept Uranium One as its name and was based out of Toronto. Though it was based in Canada, Uranium One has mines, mills and land in Wyoming, Utah and other U.S. states equal to about 20 percent of the U.S. uranium production capacity. It’s actual production, though, is actually a smaller portion of the uranium produced in the U.S., at 11 percent in 2014, according to Oilprice.com. Under the terms of the deal, UrAsia shareholders kept a 60 percent stake in the new company until June 2010, when Russia’s nuclear agency, Rosatom, completed purchase of a 51 percent stake. But the deal had to be approved by multiple U.S. agencies first, including the Committee on Foreign Investments in the United States, or CFIUS —on which the U.S. Secretary of State sits. The committee approved the proposal, and in 2013, Russia assumed 100 percent ownership of the company and renamed it Uranium One Holding. The deal, however, was not Clinton’s to approve alone. The CFIUS panel also includes the attorney general and the secretaries of the Treasury, Defense, Commerce, Energy and Homeland Security, as well as the heads of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The claim makes it seem like Clinton had the power of vetoing or approving the deal, which she did not. Clinton has said that she was not personally involved and, in a New York Times article, then-Assistant Secretary of State Jose Fernandez, who represented the State Department on the panel, said Clinton ""never intervened"" in CFIUS matters. It is accurate that nine individuals related to the company donated to the Clinton Foundation but the bulk of the money —$131 million — came from Giustra. And Giustra said he sold off his entire stake in the company in 2007, three years before the Russia deal and about 18 months before Clinton became secretary of state. We couldn’t independently verify Giustra’s claim, but if he is telling the truth, the donation amount to the Clinton Foundation from Uranium One investors drops significantly —from $145 million to $4 million. Of the remaining individuals connected with Uranium One, the only one found to have donated to the Clinton Foundation during the deal’s time frame was Ian Telfer. Telfer was an investor who the New York Times found contributed between $1.3 million and $5.6 million to the foundation during and after the review process for the deal. So while it isn’t wrong to question links between foundation donors and their ties to Uranium One, this specific charge was exaggerated. A 2017 report by The Hill revealed that Rosatom’s main executive, Vadim Mikerin, orchestrated ""a racketeering plot involving kickbacks, bribes and extortion designed to grow Vladimir Putin’s atomic energy business inside the United States."" This was revealed by an undercover FBI informant who had infiltrated Uranium One in 2009 – a year before the deal was approved by CFIUS. At the time, Mueller was the director of the FBI, and one would assume he would have been aware of the ongoing investigation. But in the Hill article, Assistant FBI Director Ronald Hosko was quoted saying he did not recall ever being briefed on the case. ""‘I had no idea this case was being conducted,’ a surprised Hosko said in an interview,"" the article reported. Again, it's somewhat unclear what the post means when it says Mueller ""delivered it,"" but there is no evidence Mueller played a role in the Uranium One transaction. The other implication is that Clinton either did know or should have known about problems with the Russian bid for Uranium One before deciding whether to let it go forward. Same goes for President Barack Obama, who had the power to veto the transfer. For now at least, we aren’t aware of any evidence that Clinton knew anything about the FBI investigation. If anything, the Hill’s reporting suggests the opposite. If the assistant FBI director at the time knew nothing of the investigation, then Clinton -- someone in a different department and several rungs higher in the organizational chart -- might not have known about it. A Facebook post claims that Hillary Clinton transferred uranium to Russia in exchange for donations to the Clinton Foundation. It also says Robert Mueller was involved. The claim makes it seem like Clinton bears responsibility for the deal when a panel of several departments and agencies were part of its approval. And while the connections between the Clinton Foundation and the Russian deal may appear fishy, there is no proof of any quid pro quo. As for Mueller, the ties are even more specious.

163,"[Claim]:The iPhone 13 requires vaccination to unlock and can secretly vaccinate its user.[Evidences]:A video has been shared repeatedly on WhatsApp in Nigeria that Apple’s iPhone 13 series requires vaccination before it can be used.

The video, which has been in circulation a few days after the introduction of the iPhone 13, is shared with different captions.

One caption states: “You can’t use iPhone 13 without being vaccinated!”; another insinuated that the phone secretly vaccinates its user.

It reads: “Here’s iPhone 13, it can secretly vaccinate you once you have it in your hands. It can dictate if you are vaccinated or not, report you to the police if you’re not vaccinated and it won’t work if you’re not vaccinated. Let’s be ready, we are in the end time”.

The iPhone 13 requires vaccination to unlock and can secretly vaccinate its user.

Findings by The FactCheckHub show that the claim is FALSE.

A search on the internet using frames from the video and keywords from the captions showed that the clip in circulation originated from a video posted on the YouTube channel of ‘The Babylon Bee’.

The Babylon Bee is a satirical content platform.  Its motto is ‘Fake news you can trust’. This can be seen in its description on all its social media handles.

On the ‘About us’ page on the website archived here, the platform explicitly stated it is satirical.

“The Babylon Bee is the world’s best satire site, totally inerrant in all its truth claims. We write satire about Christian stuff, political stuff, and everyday life,” it reads.

Oregon State University’s guide to literary terms, which is a series of lessons by the lecturers described satire as a literary genre or device that makes someone or something look ridiculous, raising laughter in order to embarrass, humble, or discredit its targets.

It also states that satire when used effectively and appropriately can be a powerful weapon. But it is also a risky one, as there is always the risk it be will read “straight” or superficially.

Apple, when it unveiled the iPhone 13, listed numerous features, but the ability to detect vaccination status, administer vaccination or report unvaccinated persons to the police were neither part of it nor was needing vaccination to unlock the screen stated.

However, Apple stated that the iOS 15 which the phone uses allow users to download and store verifiable digital copy of COVID-19 vaccination and test result records in the health app.

164,"[Claim]:A photograph shows two women getting golf lessons from a robot golf instructor.[Evidences]:A wide range of reputable sources over the years have shared a photograph of two women purportedly receiving a golf lesson from a robot trainer. The BBC,for instance, shared the image in a 2015 article about artificial intelligence: MashableandCNNalso used this image to illustrate articles about the history (and future) of robotics. Although this image has been featured by a number of credible sources, only a few scant sentences accompanied it in each instance: CNN: An early prototype robot was used to assist two women golfers with their swings in this 1925 picture. Mashable: A robotic trainer coaches golfers on their swings. BBC: Two golfers use a golf robot trainer to help with their golf swing in 1932. Outside of these single-sentence descriptions, we couldn’t find any information about a robot golf instructor from the 1930s. Rather, it appears that this image was taken on the set of the 1930 filmLove in the Rough. The confusion likely stemmed from a miscaptioned Getty Images photograph that was included in the gallery “In focus: Looking for the perfect golf swing?” That iteration was captioned: “Two golfers use a golf robot trainer to help with their golf swing.” However, Getty Images also included this photograph in the gallery “Classic Entertainment: Bestsellers From Moviepix 1930s” with a caption identifying one of the women in the photograph as actress Penny Singleton: American actressPenny Singleton(1908 – 2003) (known as Dorothy McNulty in the early part of her career) (right) and another actress take lessons on their golf swings from a mechanical instructor in a scene from the musical comedy ‘Love in the Rough,’ directed by Charles Reisner, 1930. The photograph does appear to show actress Penny Singleton and her co-star Dorothy Jordan,on the set ofLove In The Rough: Other apparent stills from the movie show Singleton in the same outfit. We also found two other photographs(one of which was again miscaptioned by Getty as “young couple plays golf”) of this “robot golf instructor” featuring the film’s male star Robert Montgomery: We only found one image of this robot golf instructor from a different location.

165,"[Claim]:Says Libya ""Ambassador (Christopher) Stevens sent 600 requests for help"" in Benghazi.[Evidences]:The death of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens came up as a topic during the second presidential debate Sunday night. When moderator Anderson Cooper asked Donald Trump if tweeting about a sex tape between 3 and 5 a.m. reflected the discipline of a good leader, Trump denied using those words and suddenly veered onto the subject of the 2012 attack on the mission compound in Benghazi, Libya. Security was inadequate and Stevens died of smoke inhalation from a fire during an attack by insurgents. Trump, apparently thinking that the drama unfolded at 3 a.m. in Washington, started referring to a famous Hillary Clinton commercial from her 2008 run for president, which argued that she was the best person for responding to a national emergency, as represented by a hypothetical 3 a.m. phone call to the White House. Trump: ""She said, 'Who is going to answer the call at 3 o'clock in the morning?' Guess what? She didn't answer because ... Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help."" It’s hard to overstate how much is wrong here. The attack on the compound actually began at 9:42 p.m. in Libya, which was 3:42 p.m. in Washington. By 3 a.m. in Washington the following day, the attacks were over, and the people involved had either left Benghazi or were less than an hour from being flown out. So for this fact-check, we're going to focus on whether Stevens made 600 requests for help. Trump's cryptic comment might be heard as suggesting that Stevens made 600 ""requests for help"" during the attack. The investigations of Benghazi show that didn't happen. In fact, when we contacted the Trump campaign, they referred us to a graph that claimed something very different. First, there's no debate that security at the mission was inadequate and that requests for improvements stalled or rejected. Some security improvements were made the year of the attack, including ""heightening the perimeter wall, installing concrete Jersey barriers, mounting safety grills on the safe area windows, and other minor improvements,"" according to a 2014 Senate Select Committee on Intelligence report. But while the CIA was making significant upgrades to its nearby annex, similar improvements were not being done at the Benghazi mission. The CIA annex had nine security officers, but only three officers were assigned to the mission complex. A month before the attack, with the security situation deteriorating, Army Gen. Carter Ham, who was head of U.S. Africa Command, twice offered to give the U.S. embassy in Tripoli a special military security team. Stevens declined the offer. No reason was given, but it may have had to do with the State Department not wanting to aggravate the political instability in Libya with the presence of U.S. forces. When we contacted the Trump campaign, spokesman Dan Kowalski cited this chart, which was displayed during hearings by the Republican-led House Select Committee on Benghazi. But there's no reference to this chart in the report itself, released months later. Democrats on the committee, in their minority report, said that, ""During our hearing with Secretary Clinton, Rep. Mike Pompeo (R-Kan) argued that the Select Committee had obtained ‘over 600 requests’ for security from Benghazi, but he refused to provide the evidence for his claim."" The minority report continues, ""Democrats have been unable to successfully reconstruct a list of 600 requests for additional security, and have been able to identify fewer than 200 requests, many of which were granted."" A few things are worth noting right off the bat. • The Republicans’ count is 569, not 600, accumulated over nine months. • Stevens wasn't sworn in as ambassador to Libya until May 2012. So even if every one of those requests/concerns originated from Stevens and went directly to Clinton, the highest number Trump could cite would be 205, not 600. • The count is supposed to be the number of security requests or concerns from Benghazi to the State Department, not from Stevens to Clinton, as Trump said. This can get ambiguous because such correspondence is often sent under the name of the ambassador, even if he/she never saw it, to the secretary of state, even though in the vast majority of cases it's handled by lower-level people and the secretary never sees it. As Clinton noted during her Jan. 23, 2013, testimony on the Benghazi attack, ""1.43 million cables a year come to the State Department. They are all addressed to me. They do not all come to me. They are reported through the bureaucracy."" It's also not clear if all these requests were actually for Benghazi or were security-related requests involving the U.S. embassy in Tripoli as well. Earlier this year, the Washington Post Fact Checker looked into the 600 number, which was being cited by Trump and others. He found duplication. Once a request is made it can be followed by one or more statements of ""concern"" on the same topic, so there's a lot of overlap in the count. The Postwas given only a cursory look at the data used by the GOP staff to come up with their total, but he noted that one subject heading was repeated 17 times, suggesting that the same request was being repeatedly discussed. That alone may have inflated the total. To properly check whether the same security-related requests were being reported under different subject headings, the committee would have to release the documents. At the time, Kessler was reporting that the committee's final report ""is supposed to list the documents that formed the basis of the 600 figure."" We contacted the committee twice and received no response. If we get additional information, we'll update this fact-check. In any event, Kessler noted, ""few if any"" requests were likely from Stevens. He called Trump's comment ""a whopper."" Our ruling Trump said ""Ambassador Stevens sent 600 requests for help."" There certainly were many requests for security improvements at the mission. But Trump goes way over the line, citing a graph that includes a period when Stevens wasn't even the ambassador and doesn't differentiate between actual requests for improved security and follow-up correspondence. The highest the number could be, according to that data, is 205 and there's no evidence that those ""requests and concerns"" — which may include duplicates — were even sent by Stevens.

167,"[Claim]:Lawmakers were paid for their off-season efforts to, for the first time, take the lead in drawing borders for two would-be cities.[Evidences]:A border battle between two would-be cities in north-central DeKalb County took center stage in a lengthy House debate on Day 39 of the 40-day legislative session. Boundary disputes between the proposed cities of Lakeside and Tucker killed cityhood efforts last year. A House subcommittee brokered a compromise in December between Tucker and what was renamed LaVista Hills after the two sides again failed to agree on borders. The subcommittee’s chairman, Rep. Buzz Brockway, R-Lawrenceville, said at the time that the boundaries were ""set in stone."" But the Senate voted to move about 2,000 people and some commercial property out of Tucker and into LaVista Hills, setting up the tense House debate that saw subcommittee members successfully beat back the altered map. The two chambers eventually struck a deal to split the disputed territory between the two proposed cities. But in that House vote, speaking in the parlance of a floor debate, Rep. Mary Margaret Oliver, D-Decatur, repeated commitments from the subcommittee. ""Isn’t it true that we were paid a per diem in December to resolve this dispute, to set this border in stone?"" Oliver asked. Traditional response dictates the response: If the lady so states. But what about her underlying point: Taxpayers funded a subcommittee’s work to hammer out borders of proposed cities when advocates couldn’t agree, only to see that public commitment nearly unravel in the waning days of the session. PolitiFact Georgia decided to find out. First, it’s important to understand how state legislators are compensated. The 180 members of the House and 56 members of the Senate earn $17,342 in annual salary for their service. They can also earn $173 a day for expenses such as lodging and meals, or up $6,920 for the annual legislative session. Despite being part-time lawmakers, their obligations don’t end when the gavel bangs to end the session. That’s why members also qualify for that $173 per diem any time in the ""off-season"" that they must take time off from work and travel for constituent services, to participate in regular committees, such as the busy Transportation Committee, and when serving on a special committee tasked with studying a particular policy area. Oliver was one of five members of the special House subcommittee charged with helping draw borders for the proposed DeKalb cities. The unusual thing about the subcommittee: It was the first time the full House set up such a group to help draw borders for new cities. And the full House agreed to abide by the subcommittee’s decision, as long as both cityhood groups did, too. Records show the subcommittee met Dec. 3 and Dec. 19 before voting during its second session to draw the borders. The deal also allowed the cityhood bills to advance in one year instead of the customary two years. ""Our agreement to allow a shortened process means this line is frozen,"" Brockway told WABE-FM (90.1) about the borders at the time. Representatives from both cityhood efforts agreed at the time to the deal. So, too, did House members. And records with the General Assembly Fiscal Office show the House members of the subcommitee did file for and earn per diems by registering their attendance with Brockway. Brockway and Oliver earned $173 each for the Dec. 3 session, as did state Reps. Barry Fleming, R-Harlem; Mark Hamilton. R-Cumming; and Howard Mosby, D-Atlanta. Per diem was paid again for the attendees of the Dec. 19 meeting: Brockway, Hamilton, Mosby and Oliver. The total per diems paid out for the two meetings, not including any mileage filed at 56 cents per mile, totaled $1,557. ""Our work was done in the public, as official work, and I don’t think it’s right to agree to change an act of a full subcommittee being paid to work,"" Oliver told PolitiFact Georgia after the House vote (but before the final deal). As the last-day deal shows, the two chambers were able to come to an agreement that divvied up the disputed area near Spaghetti Junction. Once the governor signs the bills, about 100,000 people will decide this fall on whether to form one or both cities. The debate about those boundaries nearly killed those votes for the second year in a row. Oliver said that taxpayers paid for lawmakers to work out a deal for both sides. State records back up that claim. We rate Oliver’s statement True.",True,True
168,"[Claim]:A video shows an election worker in Clark County, Washington, improperly closing a ballot drop box 30 minutes early, making a voter put their ballot in a bag instead.[Evidences]:CLAIM: A video shows an election worker in Clark County, Washington, improperly closing a ballot drop box 30 minutes early, making a voter put their ballot in a bag instead.AP’S ASSESSMENT: False. The drop box was not closed and the election worker told the voter they could still deposit their ballot into the box if they did not wish to put it into the bag. Clark County election officials and the Washington Secretary of State’s office say election workers are able to collect ballots from voters near drop boxes to speed up the process, prevent the boxes from overflowing and to ensure that everyone who is in line can vote before the 8 p.m. deadline.THE FACTS: The video clip showing a drivers’ interaction with the election worker has circulated widely on social media since the local primary election last week.The footage was filmed by a driver who was in the queue to drop off a ballot at a transit center in unincorporated Clark County, near Vancouver, Washington. In the clip, the worker can be seen standing alongside the cars holding an open bag facing the drivers. The drop box is visible a little further down the road.The woman recording the video asks the election worker: “Why are you not allowing us to put them in the ballot box?” The worker responds by saying that it takes them roughly 25 minutes to retrieve all the ballots in the drop box and that they have to close it right at 8 p.m. The worker then says that the driver can still drop off their ballot at the box if they prefer.Many social media users claimed that the footage showed corrupt activity. One Twitter user wrote on Thursday, “Nothing to see here, just a darker shade of corrupt snatching of red votes: Clark County, WA collecting ballots in an open knapsack.”“ILLEGAL: Clark County election workers closed the ballot drop boxes 30 mins prior to closing,” another user falsely claimed.But the claims are misrepresenting the incident. The box was not closed, and the worker was providing extra collection support, which officials say is routine in the state. Washington state election law and administrative code permit election officials to accept ballots from voters at ballot drop boxes, Clark County Auditor Greg Kimsey, who oversees elections in the county, and the secretary of state’s office said in separate statements to The Associated Press.The practice is intended to speed up the process and ensure that every voter who is in line to drop off a ballot at a designated site by 8 p.m. can do so, Kimsey said, adding that the county has historically experienced long lines at the end of election day.“By giving voters the option of depositing their ballot with an election administrator (who is clearly identifiable by their badge and vest) the line moves much more quickly enabling election administrators to identify the vehicle that is last in line at 8 p.m.,” Kimsey’s statement continued.All ballots, including those given directly to an election worker, are secured in official ballot bags and delivered to the elections office, Kimsey added. Election observers are also present at the end of election day at ballot drop boxes in Clark County, and there were “three certified election observers representing the Republican party” at the site when the video was recorded, he noted.Washington is among a handful of states that conduct all of their elections by mail, outside of one in-person voting center in each county. All registered voters are sent a ballot in the mail. The voter completes the ballot, places it in a secure inner envelope and then into a separate mailing envelope and signs an affidavit. The envelopes don’t display any party affiliation or voting choices. The voter then either mails off the ballot or returns it to a drop off location.Such drop off locations can be staffed or unstaffed. The Washington Secretary of State’s office confirmed that the actions captured in the video at a staffed drop location were permitted under laws and codes that aim to prevent the overflow of ballot boxes and allow for the collection of ballots in secure storage containers.“Election workers providing additional support, particularly when lines get long in order to expedite ballot submission, is not uncommon,” spokesperson Amy Lin wrote in an email.The office pointed to alaw on ballot drop boxesthat requires county auditors to prevent them from overflowing, saying that in this video, the election workers were following the law by ensuring that a long line of last minute voters wouldn’t overwhelm the drop box as the deadline approached.Stuart Holmes, Washington’s acting director of elections, also cited a section of thestate codeonsecure storage, which allows ballots to be placed in containers such as the bag pictured. The bag in the video appeared to be a ballot transfer carrier with the ability to be securely sealed, he said, adding that ballots from the drop box would also ultimately be placed into such containers.“When you combine those two statutes together it really amounts to making sure that people who are in their vehicles ⁠— which creates a massive line ⁠— are able to get through the line and process their ballot,” Holmes said.Washington Administrative Coderequires deposit site staff to “subscribe to an oath regarding the discharge of their duties,” and Holmes noted that there would be criminal consequences if any workers handled the ballots improperly.Patrick L. Schoettmer, a politics professor at Seattle University who researches voting behavior and regularly observes voting at local drop boxes, reviewed the video and confirmed that he didn’t see anything “abnormal or or out of order.”“That could strike me as being a legitimate acceptance of a ballot of someone who was already in line,” he added.___This is part of AP’s effort to address widely shared misinformation, including work with outside companies and organizations to add factual context to misleading content that is circulating online.Learn more about fact-checking at AP.",False,True

Also, the warranty for the battery is for 10 yrs.[Evidences]:Of late, a post claiming that Tata Motors had launched an electric vehicle called Evision which once charged can run up to 1000 km is doing rounds on social media. Also claiming that the battery warranty is for 10 years, the post is viral on social media. The single charge 1000 km is a world record. Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post. Archived version the post can be seen here. Claim: Tata motors has launched a new electric car named Evision, which on one charge can run up to 1000kms which is a world record. Also, the warranty for the battery is for 10 yrs. Fact: Tata Group showcased the Evision car whose design is based on omega architecture back in 2018 in Geneva Motor show. There is no information about the battery and warranty for the battery on the company’s website. Also, the commercial production of the vehicle has not started yet. Speaking to Times of India, company CEO said the concept is technically feasible but commercially not viable. Hence the claim made in the post is FALSE. When we ran a search on the internet using the keywords tata motors evision, we found that the car was showcased in 2018 Geneva Motor Show and the design is based on OMEGA (Optimal Modular Efficient Global Advanced) architecture. The same information is available here and here. Hence it is clear that the image which is going viral is an old one. As far as the battery and warranty for the battery are concerned, Tata Motors has not mentioned anywhere about these aspects of the vehicle. There is also no mention about these aspects of the vehicle in the product note and specification sheet of evision which can be found on their website. When the same claim went viral in 2018, many have debunked these false claims which can be read here and here. Suresh Rangarajan, the then Head of Corporate Communications at Tata Motors, has also clarified that “fake news that has been travelling far and wide – no such announcements made by the company. Someone’s imagination running wild.” Also, this is a concept car. Regular production of the car has not yet started and the information regarding future production is not known. Recently in January 2020, speaking to Times of India about the company’s electric plans, Guenter Butschek CEO & MD, said that they had launched an electric vehicle based on omega architecture in Geneva 2018 and suggested that the concept is technically feasible but not commercially viable.

170,"[Claim]:Thousands of U.S. Postal Service mailboxes were removed during the last Obama administration term, according to a 2016 report.[Evidences]:Amidst mounting concerns over the U.S. Postal Service’s ability to handle an influx of mail-in ballots for the November 2020 election due to COVID-19 quarantines, a spate of mailbox removals across the country in the summer of 2020 led to accusations from Democrats that U.S. President Donald Trump’s Republican administration was hindering the voting process. In response, numerous conservative media outlets argued in August 2020 that thousands of mailboxes were also removed during U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration — mainly from 2011 to 2016. Snopes readers asked us to verify whether mailboxes had indeed been removed during the Obama years. We learned this was true — but some context is in order. Here’s the background: In the summer of 2020, Democrats accused the Trump administration of actively harming the Postal Service’s ability to function in an effort to hurt the voting process in November. Reports mounted of mailboxes being removed, high-speed mail sorting machines being taken out of service, and postal workers being asked to work reduced hours. Trump also said he opposed additional funding for the Postal Service because that could make mail-in voting easier (which he has argued would favor Democrats), though he clarified he was concerned about voter fraud (a claim we have debunked). In mid-August, the Postal Service warned states that workers may not be able to deliver ballots on time based on current election rules. We could neither prove nor disprove the Democrats’ claims in a previous investigation. Conservative media — including Fox News, Breitbart, and The Blaze — countered the accusations from Trump’s critics by referring to an August 2016 report from the Postal Service’s Office of Inspector General that outlined the declining number of mail-collection boxes during the previous five years. Nationally, the number of collection boxes declined by more than 12,000, from 2011 to 2016. This decline was criticized by customers at the time, who said USPS had “gone too far.” However, the reasons for the decline in the number of mailboxes during the Obama years appeared to have little to do with politics surrounding elections. According to the 2016 report: As the Postal Service adapts its collection infrastructure to meet customers’ needs at a reasonable cost, it has eliminated underused collection boxes that on average receive fewer than 25 pieces a day, and added collection boxes that are convenient for customers. In fact, the number of blue steel mailboxes across the U.S. has been steadily declining for decades under various administrations. In 1985, the country had 400,000 mailboxes. In 2011, there were 160,000. Today, there are around 142,000 collection boxes in operation.Many blame the gradual death of the Postal Service on the growth of the internet, labor costs, and congressional meddling. Since he took over in June 2020, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy instituted the aforementioned series of changes that led to accusations from Democrats that the Postal Service was being deliberately gutted. He also announced a hiring freeze and banned “unnecessary overtime,” and reports grew of letters piling up at post offices as mail-sorting equipment was removed. DeJoy has also been a prominent political ally to Trump, which fueled some of the fire, too. On Aug. 18, after public outcry, DeJoy announced that mailboxes would no longer be removed. U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tweeted that she had a conversation with DeJoy where he admitted that he did not intend to replace the missing infrastructure, which she feared would disenfranchise voters. In his statement, DeJoy said: The Postal Service is ready today to handle whatever volume of election mail it receives this fall. Even with the challenges of keeping our employees and customers safe and healthy as they operate amid a pandemic […] Snopes reached out to the Postal Service for details about the quantity of mailboxes that had been removed in 2020, and how that compared with the number of mailboxes removed during the Obama years. The agency did not offer specifics, with a spokesperson telling us that removals are often instituted due to declining mail volumes: […]the Postal Service reviews collection box density every year on a routine basis to identify redundant/seldom used collection boxes as First-Class Mail volume continues to decline. Based on the density testing, boxes are identified for potential removal and notices are placed on boxes to give customers an opportunity to comment before the removal decision is made. To sum up, it is true that the number of mailboxes fell significantly in the Obama years, but this was part of a decades-long decline. The politically motivated argument also established a false equivalency by comparing vastly different time ranges, and disregarding how the many policy changes instituted over the last few months could potentially impact voting by mail. We thus rate this claim as “Mostly True.”",True,True
171,"[Claim]:""Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers’ money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism.""[Evidences]:Scott Dawson, an evangelical minister running for governor in Alabama, accused the incumbent of funnelling taxpayer dollars to a controversial cause. ""It's been uncovered that Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers’ money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism,"" Dawson’s campaign wrote in a press release. The organization in question is Free2Be, a non-profit that provides counseling services to LGBTQ victims of domestic violence and bullying in Alabama. The nonprofit has been the subject of heavy scrutiny in Alabama, but for financial reasons, not political ones. After the group’s founder, James Robinson, left the group in January, the board of directors determined that Free2Be did not have the financial stability to continue. The group shuttered its doors after a state agency found they had failed to pay payroll taxes to the IRS. Dawson’s campaign pointed us to a 2012 YouTube video as evidence Free2be is a ""liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism."" The video didn’t suggest the organization aimed to change anyone’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Neither do the group’s public statements. Instead, Robinson railed against messages of hate from teachers, parents and churches towards LGBTQ teens. So what taxpayer funding did the group receive until they landed in hot water? Dawson’s campaign overshot the target by a few hundred thousand dollars with their $1 million figure. The campaign calculated that Free2Be received $762,042.37 in federal grants since Ivey assumed office in April 2017, using data from Alabama’s Finance Department. But the Alabama Department of Economic and Community Affairs, which reviews grant applications and presents funding recommendations to the governor’s office for approval, announces grants on an annual basis. Ivey’s administration was responsible for approving $800,000 in grants for fiscal year 2018, which began in October 2017. Of that total, $727,410 came from the Victims of Crime Act, which is part of the U.S. Department of Justice, and $49,915 from the federal Family Violence Prevention and Services Act. The grants refunded expenses incurred by the organization. Those payments stopped in late March, when Free2Be shut down, and added up to $422,680.37. In fiscal year 2018, the state awarded $23.5 million in Victims of Crime Act grants to 79 nonprofit or governmental agencies across Alabama, said Department of Economic and Community Affairs spokesman Josh Carples. Free2Be was one of those recipients. The law requires that 10 percent of Victims of Crime Act grant funding go to underserved victims of violent crime each year. The agency started to look for LGBTQ grant recipients in 2013, after a program specialist noticed the agency was not funding any providers that serviced that community. Because it qualified as underserved, the specialist suggested the agency begin LGBTQ outreach. The following year, Free2Be was the only Victims of Crime Act applicant serving the LGBTQ population, and the agency approved their grant request. Ivey’s campaign argued that the grants were not funded by taxpayer dollars, but by federal criminal fees. The Office for Victims of Crime’s website uses a similar distinction as Ivey in describing these grants: ""The Fund is financed by fines and penalties paid by convicted federal offenders, not from tax dollars."" But Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said there is a distinction between tax dollars and taxpayer dollars. ""User fees are, technically, not ‘tax dollars’ in that they are not the product of our tax system,"" Gardner said. ""But the broader claim that these are not ‘taxpayer dollars’ doesn't seem right. When we pay the $20 entrance fee to visit a national park, we're not paying a tax. But most people would say that $20 is ‘taxpayer dollars’ in that the government collected it from people, and will spend it on some public services."" Gardner likened a $20 park fee to the fines and penalties paid by federal offenders. Susan Pace Hamill, a professor at the University of Alabama School of Law, agreed. ""Criminal fines and forfeitures are not typical taxes, but resemble typical taxes because they represent dollars collected involuntarily and are used for some public purpose,"" Hamill said. Dawson said, ""It's been uncovered that Gov. Kay Ivey gave nearly $1 million of taxpayers’ money to a liberal activist organization that promotes alternative lifestyles and transgenderism."" The organization in question is Free2Be, a victims resources nonprofit that serviced the LGBTQ community. Dawson distorted the organization’s purpose, which was to support LGBTQ victims of domestic violence and bullying in Alabama, not to change anyone’s gender identity or sexual orientation. The Ivey administration approved almost $800,000 in grants to Free2Be in order to meet a federal grant quota for underserved communities. But the group did not receive the full amount before it closed in March; it received a little more than half of that funding. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.",Conflicting,True

173,"[Claim]:""Every billion dollars we spend on highway construction results in 47,500 jobs. But the fact is the average American is sitting in traffic 38 hours a year.""[Evidences]:Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has sometimes strayed from Republican orthodoxy during his long-shot bid for the GOP nomination, most notably when it comes to economic issues. He often touts his success in Arkansas improving the state's transportation infrastructure, so it was no surprise on Jan. 30, 2008, when he argued that highway spending would be a better means of stimulating the economy than the rebate checks that President Bush and Congress have in mind. ""Every billion dollars we spend on highway construction results in 47,500 jobs,"" he said during the Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif. And while Americans may love the thought of a $600 check from the government – as the House passed as part of its economic stimulus bill this week – they also would thank their government for reducing traffic congestion. ""The fact is the average American is sitting in traffic 38 hours a year,"" Huckabee said. Huckabee is on well-trod ground here. But in the first case, he's using data so old that it can't possibly be true anymore. In the second, he misstates the results of a prominent study. Huckabee's not alone in arguing that $1-billion in highway spending equates to 47,500 jobs. The equation has been widely cited in recent years by officials of the U.S. Department of Transportation, members of Congress and transportation advocacy groups. Unfortunately, the study that made the finding is now 12 years old, 13 if you figure the data used was from 1995. The study was published in 1996 by the Federal Highway Administration. And in actuality, the author – economist Thomas P. Keane – found that $1-billion in federal spending created 42,100 jobs – 7,900 in direct highway construction, another 19,700 in related construction industry jobs and another 14,500 in unrelated jobs sparked by the construction, including everything from vendors who sell coffee to the workers to teachers who instruct their children. Advocates of highway spending have used the data to argue that $1-billion in federal spending would typically be matched by $100-million in state matching funds, tacking on the remaining 5,400 jobs cited by Huckabee. But the Transportation Department has never updated its findings and inflation has surely cut into the jobs that $1-billion, or even $1.1-billion, would create, says Frank R. Moretti, director of policy and research at TRIP, a Washington nonprofit group that advocates for policies to reduce traffic congestion. ""You would anticipate wages have been impacted over the last 13 years,"" he says, reducing – potentially significantly – the amount of jobs created. Likewise Huckabee slips up a bit in citing a Texas Transportation Institute study examining the number of hours Americans spend stuck in traffic each year. The institute's September 2007 ""Urban Mobility Report"" found that congestion causes the average peak period traveler to spend an extra 38 hours in traffic each year. However, the average peak period traveler isn't the same as the ""average American"" that Huckabee cited. In fact, only about 60 percent of Americans travel during the 8 hours a day that the institute defines as the ""peak period"" – between 5 a.m. and 9 a.m. in the morning and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. during the evening rush. Senior citizens, stay-at-home parents, small children and the unemployed are among the 40 percent that typically don't. If they were factored in – thereby calculating how much time the average American spends in traffic – the 38-hour figure would likely drop into the 25-hour range, says David Schrank, a co-author of the report. So Huckabee's facts are off, though not egregiously. His first error is in relying on the U.S. Department of Transportation, which continues to cite a 12-year-old statistic. The second misstatement is an exaggeration of a study. We rate both statements, therefore, as Barely True. ",Conflicting,Conflicting

""This is COVID-19, not COVID-1, folks. And so you would think that people charged with the World Health Organization facts and figures would be on top of that."" ""People should know the facts,"" she added. The comment came one day after President Donald Trump announced his intention to halt U.S. funding to the WHO and review its handling of the virus. But the name of the disease doesn’t mean the WHO had 18 chances to learn about coronaviruses before the latest strain hit. COVID-19 is short for ""coronavirus disease 2019,"" a name that reflects the year in which the disease was first identified. The WHO announced the name on Feb. 11. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ""CO"" stands for ""corona,"" ""VI"" stands for ""virus,"" and ""D"" stands for ""disease."" Before the WHO formalized a name for the disease, it was referred to as the ""2019 novel coronavirus"" or ""2019-nCoV."" The virus itself, by contrast, is known as ""severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2"" and abbreviated as ""SARS-CoV-2,"" according to the WHO. The CDC lists seven coronaviruses that are known to infect humans, some of which are relatively common. Conway was clearer about the origins of ""COVID-19"" during a separate interview with Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo roughly 30 minutes after her comment on ""Fox & Friends."" ""It’s called COVID-19 because that’s the year, that’s the year,"" Conway said while ripping the WHO’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. ""It’s not COVID-20. It’s COVID-19.""

176,"[Claim]:“Compliance levels with parole and probation conditions have improved to reach a historic mark of 98%.”[Evidences]:Amidst unprecedented security measures, South Africa's President Jacob Zuma delivered his tenth State of the Nation Address on 9 February 2017. We fact-checked his speech.EnergyClaim “To date, nearly 7 million households have been connected to the grid and now have the electricity."" Verdict correctSouth Africa’sdevelopment indicatorsshowed that 6,340,321 households had been connected to the grid as of 2013/14. A further233,455 were connected in 2014/15and231,012 were connected in 2015/16. Figures for 2016/17 have yet to be released.Zuma’s claim is correct based on these figures. They show that a total of 6,804,788 households - nearly 7 million - were connected as of 31 March 2016.As of 2016,90,3% of South African householdshad access to electricity for lighting. - Kate WilkinsonEducationClaim ""Among the participating countries [in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study] South Africa has shown the largest improvement of 87 points in mathematics and 90 points in science."" Verdict correctThe Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) is conducted every 4 years and provides participating countries with the means to compare pupil performance in maths and science.Grade 4 and Grade 8 pupils are tested in most of the countries that take part in the study. However, in South Africa, Grade 5 and 9 pupils are tested.The 2015 study found that South Africa’s Grade 9 pupils recorded the “biggest positive change”. There was an improvement of 90 points in science and 87 points in mathematics.The report goes on to note that “South Africa started with very low performance scores in 2003 and this upward shift translates to an overall performance improvement by approximately two grade levels between 2003 and 2015”.While South African Grade 9 pupils did record a large improvement, in comparison to other countries they fared badly. Out of the 39 countries assessed, South Africa’s Grade 9 students placed 38th for mathematics performance and 39th for science performance. - Kate WilkinsonSouth African pupils not ‘second worst in the world’ in maths & scienceClaim “Government also settled all debt owed by National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) students.” Verdict misleadingThe media unit of theNational Student Financial Aid Scheme(NSFAS) as well as its spokesman, Tsepo Kanye, both referred Africa Check toalengthy statement issued by the scheme earlier this year. It stated that “the historic debt of all students who qualify for NSFAS has been resolved”.However, the statement shows that students will still have to repay their debt - but to NSFAS under a new agreement, not their university.First, funds to clear their debt were made available for students who applied for and qualified for NSFAS loans in 2013, 2014 and 2015. These students were either partly funded or underfunded by NSFAS and have therefore accumulated a debt over those years. NSFAS said this affected 71,753 students.“Students who are still studying, dropped out or graduated within the stipulated academic years” can have these loan payments effected, the NSFAS statement said.Second, the debt will be cleared in the form of a loan provided to qualifying students based on the means test available from these students’ previous NSFAS applications in 2013, 2014 and 2015.Third, the loan is intended to be convertible to a bursary. Based on students’ academic performance, up to 40% of the loan can be converted to a bursary during studies. The full loan amount is convertible to a bursary when the students meetgraduation requirements during their final year of study.Finally, NSFAS said it will pay the principal or “capital” amount owed by the student to the university.Kagisho Mamabolo, the national spokesman in the office of the head of NSFAS told Africa Check that universities agreed that they will not charge interest on these students’ historic debt.NSFAS told us that payments have already been disbursed to universities. We were unable to check with each individual university, but the University of the Witwatersrand’s NSFAS supervisor, Portia Simelane, told Africa Check that “some outstanding claims have been paid by NSFAS”.As such, the “historical debt” has not been “settled” but deferred under less stringent conditions. The claim by the president is therefore misleading.- Vinayak BhardwajClaim ""A total of 173 inappropriate [schools] have been eradicated since 2011."" Verdict correctThe department of basic education replaces unsafe and “inappropriate” school structures under theAccelerated Schools Infrastructure Delivery Initiative(Asidi) programme which started in 2011.As of July 2016, 170 schools had been replaced,a department presentation to the select committee on basic educationshowed. At the time of Zuma’s speech, the department’s figures showed that173 had been replaced. Thelatest figuredisplayed on the department’s website puts the number of schools at 174.The programme is far behind schedule, however. Initially,496 schoolswere identified as “inappropriate structures”. Of those, 50 schools were meant to be replaced in 2011/12, 100 schools in 2012/13 and the last 346 schools in 2013/14.- Kate WilkinsonEmploymentClaim “In terms of the 2015 to 2016 information submitted to the Employment Equity Commission, the representation of whites at top management levels amounted to 72%, while African representation was at 10%.

The latest figures were provided by the department of environmental affairs in a September 2016media release. This was confirmed to Africa Check by departmental spokesman, Albi Modise.Between January and August 2016, 702 rhinos were poached countrywide, compared to 796 rhinos between January and July 2015 and a total of 1,175 rhino poaching incidents for the whole year, as recorded by theGlobal Initiative against Transnational Organized Crime.While this does indicate a decline in the incidents of poached rhinos (40 fewer incidents were recorded in 2015 than in 2014), this is a relatively small decline when compared to the steady increase in poaching incidents since 2008.Africa Check will only be able to verify this claim once the 2016 figures have been released.- Gopolang MakouYear Recorded incidents 2008 83 2009 122 2010 333 2011 448 2012 668 2013 1,004 2014 1,215 2015 1,175CrimeClaim “Within the National Prosecuting Authority, the Asset Forfeiture Unit completed 389 forfeiture cases to the value of R349 million.” Verdict correctFollowing a successful investigation or prosecution,the money that is recovered by the statefrom freezing orders is referred to as the value of “completed forfeitures”.The National Prosecuting Authority’s latestannual reportshows that 389 forfeiture cases were completed by the Asset Forfeiture Unit during 2015/2016, like the president said.These completed cases were valued at R349.5 million, exceeding the R210 million that was projected to be recovered by R139.5 million. The annual report credits a focus on high-value cases, improved investigations and “the increased use of non-conviction based forfeiture” for the better-than-projected performance.The table below shows how the 2015/16 results compare to previous years:Financial year Value of completed forfeitures 2009/10 R185 million 2010/11 R212 million 2011/12 R164 million 2012/13 R119 million 2013/14 R296.4 million 2014/15 R1,939 million 2015/16 R349.5 million- Gopolang MakouClaim ""Last year, I signed into law a provision to criminalise the cartels and collusion and it came into effect on 1 May. It carries jail sentences of up to 10 years."" Verdict correctZuma prefaced this claim by saying that collusion by cartels “squeeze out small players and hamper the entry of young entrepreneurs and black industrialists”.It is likely that the president was referring to the proclamationsigned in Maylast year which insertedsection 73A into and amended section 74of the existingCompetition Act.The actual amendment act was passed by parliament in 2009, but various provisions of the amendment have been signed into effect periodically,director in the competition practice of law firm Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr,Lara Granville, explained to Africa Check.This amendment act introduced provisions to deal with “other practices that tend to prevent or distort competition in the market for any particular goods or services”, Granville said. Additionally, the act brings about provisions to hold personally accountable those individuals who “cause firms to engage in cartel conduct”.Thepenalties for these offencesare a fine “not exceeding R500,000 or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 years, or to both a fine and such imprisonment”.However, the new penalties could deter people from coming forward with information about collusion, Granville said. “While criminalisation may be an effective deterrent to cartel conduct, it may prevent people blowing the whistle about cartels to the competition tribunal due to fear of prosecution.”- Vinayak BhardwajClaim “Compliance levels with parole and probation conditions have improved to reach a historic mark of 98%.” Verdict correctSpeaking about fighting crime, Zuma said one of government’s strategies “is to ensure that those who are released from prison do not commit crime again”.The department of correctional services’2015/16 annual reportshows that 51,307 of the 51,937 people (98.78%) released during that period complied with the conditions of their release.However, there are problems with this narrow reading of the figures, the director of the penal programme at theLawyers for Human Rights, Clare Ballard, pointed out to Africa Check.“The ‘compliance’ that the president refers to relates to policing aspects of parole,” Ballard told Africa Check. That is, whether the parolee is at home when supposed to and whether the person is at home or work at a certain time, Ballard explained.The number doesn’t capture opportunities to help parolees escape a life of crime, by receiving drug counselling or career advice.Furthermore, offenders serving life sentences experience significant delays in being granted parole, Ballard explained.South Africaintroduced minimum mandatory sentencesin 1997. In certain instances of rape and with certain types of murders the perpetrator must receive a sentence of life imprisonment, unless there are “substantial and compelling circumstances” that justify a lesser sentence.“The department is clearly overwhelmed by the bottleneck that the minimum sentences have created,” Ballard told Africa Check. Her calculations show that South Africa has more offenders serving life sentences than ever before.“We represent hundreds of life offenders all over the country whose parole application processes have been delayed by years and years, simply because of systemic poor management of the process on the part of the parole boards, the national council of correctional services, and the minister, who has the final say on whether a life offender may be released,” she added.- Vinayak BhardwajHealthClaim “The department of social development is building new public treatment centres in provinces where there are no such facilities - in the Northern Cape, North West, Limpopo, the Free State and Eastern Cape.” Verdict correctThenational drug master planis South Africa’s plan for reducing alcohol and substance abuse, spearheaded by theCentral Drug Authority, the body responsible for itsmonitoring and implementation.According to the plan, the departments of social development and health will work together toprovide inpatient treatment facilities at community and tertiary levels.In a2016 parliamentary meeting, the deputy chairperson of the central drug authority, David Bayever, said that R150 million had been secured from treasury to build 4 public treatment centres in provinces that previously did not have these facilities: the Northern Cape, Free State, Limpopo (which, at the time, was completed but not functioning) and the Eastern Cape (which, at the time, was already functioning).National spokesman for the department of social development, Lumka Oliphant, told EWN and Africa Check that a treatment centre in the North West province has since been completed but that the centres in the Northern Cape, Free State as well as Limpopo (contradicting the parliamentary presentation) are still under construction.A year ago, the department said in amedia statementthat the Limpopo facility had already been completed. Africa Check called theSeshego Hospitalnear Polokwane,where the facility is situatedand confirmed that the building has been erected but the centre is currently not operational.Africa Check also made calls to thecentres in the North West(one located at theTaung Provincial Hospitaland another located at theWitrand Psychiatric Hospitalin Potchefstroom).

178,"[Claim]:EIA’s ‘days of supply’ figure does not show that the United States will ‘run out of diesel by Thanksgiving week’ in 2022[Evidences]:Claims on social media that the U.S. will run out of diesel fuel “by the Monday of Thanksgiving week” stem from an inaccurate interpretation of U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data on the number of days of diesel inventory left by late October, a figure that does not take into account ongoing domestic production and imports experts told Reuters. The claim was highlighted by conservative political commentator Tucker Carlson, who mentioned it during a segment of his show on Oct. 27 (youtu.be/lUZoli8oekg?t=181) “This country is about to run out of diesel fuel. According to data from the Energy Information Administration by the Monday of Thanksgiving week, that’s 25 days from now, there will be more no more diesel,” he said. He also claimed this would equate to transportation and farm equipment shutting down. Fox News was not immediately available for comment. The EIA data for the week ending October 28 showed the United States had “25.8 days” of supply of total distillate. The number reported the previous week was “25.9 days” (archive.ph/uU61y) (bit.ly/3FYIkR6) An EIA spokesperson told Reuters that the measurement for days of supply only accounts for fuel in storage. “Days of supply does not consider other sources like the amount of distillate fuel being produced at U.S. refineries and the amount of distillate fuel imported into the United States,” they said. More information on how this measure is calculated (here) Christopher Knittel, a professor of applied economics at the MIT Sloan School of Management, said the figure reflects “the amount of diesel that is currently in storage divided by the amount of fuel that we typically consume in a given day.” For the scenario presented by Fox News’s Carlson to become a reality, production and imports of diesel in the United States would have had to be completely halted. This is not the case, as shown by EIA data (here) (here) The United States would have that number of days of diesel fuel left “if all of our oil refineries stopped making fuel today,” Knittel said, a scenario he discredited. Abhi Rajendran, an adjunct research scholar at Columbia University SIPA Center on Global Energy Policy, said: “Technically that is the number of days of inventory that we have left. However, we would only run out of diesel by the Monday after Thanksgiving, if we produced zero more diesel between now and then,” Rajendran, told Reuters. Rajendran noted that the EIA inventory figure is “one of the lowest in a very long time.” Based on the EIA data, this is the lowest inventory reported in October since at least 1991, the earliest information available on the agency’s website (archive.ph/uU61y) “There are some regions of the country where it is even lower, and you are starting to see some small shortages pop up. You’re also starting to see diesel prices and cracks rapidly increase for several weeks now, and the market is certainly feeling tightness,” Rajendran said. Reuters market analyst John Kemp previously addressed this dwindling inventory, which he called a “record seasonal low.” In his Oct. 27 column (here), Kemp estimated that shortages and price spikes were “likely to occur in the next six months, unless and until the economy and fuel consumption slow.” In an analysis published on Nov. 2, the EIA said that low inventories of distillate fuel oil, which is primarily consumed as diesel, are primarily due to “less global refining capacity since 2020, as well as high demand in early 2022 and global trade disruptions later in the year linked to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine” (here)",False,True

181,"[Claim]:Says Bill Nelson voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare.[Evidences]:It is a favored line among Republican candidates to charge their Democratic opponents with cutting Medicare. U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, leveled the attack at least four times in the first half hour of Wednesday’s Florida U.S. Senate debate.Mack said incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson ""voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare to pay for Obamacare.""PolitiFact has addressed this claim many times, in many ways, in many states.Obamacare refers to the Affordable Care Act. It does not literally cut funding from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program. We should note that the Republican plan championed by GOP vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan also trims Medicare spending by almost exactly the same amount.The spending reductions fall largely on insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. The overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, even with the health care law’s cost-saving measures. The law tries to limit the program’s growth, though, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget.  $716 billion The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $716 billion. Obama and fellow Democrats say the intention is to protect beneficiaries' coverage while forcing health care providers to become more efficient. One impact of the law is it extends the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund by eight years to 2024.There is a connection between the Medicare cost savings and the health care law. At the time the health care law was being finalized, Democrats said it was important that the new law not add to the deficit. So the reductions in Medicare spending were counted against the health care law’s new spending.Some of the new spending goes toward Medicare recipients. It increases coverage for prescription drugs and offers preventive care at no cost to the patient. More significantly, though, the law moves to cover the uninsured, by giving them tax credits to buy private insurance. It also expands Medicaid, the state insurance program for the poor. The savings from Medicare offset that spending. The health law also imposes new taxes, primarily on the wealthy and on the health care industry. That, too, offsets the new spending. Our rulingMack said Nelson voted to cut $700 billion out of Medicare, to pay for Obamacare.Medicare spending increases under Obamacare, but over 10 years, it rises more slowly that it would without the law. The money comes from reducing payments to insurance companies and hospitals.Part of the savings go to reduce prescription drug payments for Medicare recipients, as well as to provide free preventive care.Overall, the lower spending extends the solvency of Medicare by eight years.We rate the statement Mostly False.",Conflicting,Conflicting

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. Since as early as October 2019, Snopes readers have inquired about headlines and social media posts that claim burning sage “kills 94% of bacteria.” In 2020, the question took on new significance for some readers as the United States grappled with a surge of reported cases of the COVID-19 coronavirus disease. Though burning some plants has been scientifically shown to eliminate airborne bacterium, there is inconclusive evidence to suggest that burning sage – or “smudging” – is capable of purifying the air in confined spaces. The “94%” claim is based on a 2007 study published in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology in which researchers analyzed the ability of “medicinal smoke” to cleanse a room of certain airborne bacteria. Reports have since circulated the internet, incorrectly lumping sage into a long ingredient list that included dried roots and leaves tested as part of the experiment. “This is highly controversial since breathing in smoke has known harms, yet the antibacterial benefits are uncertain,” Dean of Yale School of Public Health Dr. Sten Vermund told Snopes. Vermund added that there is no evidence that burning sage kills either bacteria or viruses like SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus responsible for the severe respiratory disease COVID-19. As part of the 2007 study, researchers from the National Botanical Research Institute in India burned medicinal smoke from havan samagri within a confined space to determine whether certain herbs contained antimicrobial properties. Havan samagri is a “mixture of odoriferous and medicinal herbs” that contains dozens of various types of wood, herbs, fruit and seeds used in Vedic Hindu tradition. However, sage was not included in the study’s ingredient list. One hour of burning havan samagri was shown to kill more than 94% of airborne bacteria – and the effects were not short-lived. The evidence further suggested that medicinal smoke had the ability to “purify” or “disinfect” the air for up to 24 hours in a closed room. Even after a month, the researchers found that certain pathogenic bacteria were still absent from the room, such as those that cause respiratory and gastrointestinal infections. Though it appears havan samagri may have some antimicrobial properties when burned, the findings do not suggest its use has any impact on viruses like SARS-CoV-2. This is, in part, due to the biological differences between bacteria and viruses. The Mayo Clinic notes that bacteria are capable of thriving in “many different types of environments” whereas viruses require living hosts to multiply. The way that COVID-19 spreads and how long it is present in the air also plays a role. The virus is known to transmit via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks and land in the mouth or nose of someone nearby. Evidence also suggests that the virus spreads when an individual touches a contaminated surface and then touches their mouth, eyes, or nose, though recently published guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) caution that “this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.” It is not known how long SARS-CoV-2 may persist on surfaces and research from the U.S. National Institutes of Health suggests the virus may last at least several hours and up to three days on certain surfaces. Different surfaces and different conditions – such as humidity, temperature, sunlight, and air movements – may see different results. Higher humidity, higher temperature, more airflow, and more sunlight or UV light are less-than-ideal conditions for SARS-CoV-2. “This is subject of uncertainty and will differ for indoor and outdoor spaces. Certain ‘super-spreader’ events have suggested that individuals in the wrong place (i.e. poorly ventilated indoor spaces) at the wrong time may mean considerable risk. But as a rule of thumb, aerosols can disperse across an indoor space,” explained Vermund. The CDC recommends using a combination of soap, water, and surface disinfectants identified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to sanitize spaces for the COVID-19 virus. Vermund added that heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system operations can also be adjusted or increased to spur great air circulation. “In the absence of an HVAC system in a building, strategic and well-planned outward-facing fans can be placed in windows to create a negative pressure area (as one sees in some kitchens and attics) that can decrease levels of virus in the air,” said Vermund. “Of course, mask use, physical distancing, hand/face/surface hygiene, outdoor activities, small crowds, and testing and contact tracing are all vital.” Though sage is not known to eliminate airborne bacteria or viruses, the herb has been shown to contain antiseptic properties that are beneficial to human health. Previous research has found that sage mouthwash effectively reduced the number of mouth bacteria and may work as an effective treatment for certain mental health conditions, diabetes, and cancer. Further studies have shown that sage includes anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects, among other health benefits. Smudging is an ancient ritual that holds both cultural and practical significance whereby a person burns certain plants in an effort to cleanse space. In early Indian writing dating between the 6th and 8th centuries BCE, it was believed that fumigating an operating room by burning mustard, butter, and salt was an early form of “antisepsis,” yet it was also practiced to keep evil spirits away, according to a 2018 study published in the Indian Journal of Otology. Similarly, a 2020 study published in the journal Tel Aviv described the chemical residue of marijuana and frankincense discovered at a 2,000-year-old limestone altar in modern Israel. It was thought that both were burned as a way to administer their therapeutic benefits when ceremonial participants inhaled smoke.",False,False
183,"[Claim]:""We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws.""[Evidences]:When U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan met with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel staff on Sept. 1, 2017, an editor mentioned major tax cuts adopted under Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1981. At first, Ryan joked around. ""The music was bad in those days, and the tax laws were as well,"" he replied, chuckling. ""So, I think -- I’m not a big ‘80s music guy; I’m more of a ‘70s guy."" But the 47-year-old Janesville Republican quickly got serious. Arguing that U.S. taxes are stopping U.S.-based multinational corporations from bringing giant sums of money to America, he stated: We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws. Ryan has made essentially the same claim a number of times, including on Milwaukee television, on CNBC, on Twitter and to the New York Times. So, do U.S. tax laws essentially prevent $3 trillion being held overseas from being brought to this country? Keep the word repatriate in mind. Taxing foreign earnings The object of Ryan’s criticism is the U.S. corporate tax rate. At 35 percent, as we reported in a Donald Trump fact check during the 2016 presidential campaign, it is among the highest in the world -- though it’s worth noting that, after deductions, companies typically pay an ""effective"" rate that can be much lower. (Trump, by the way, pledged during the presidential campaign to reduce the rate to 15 percent. That promise has been rated as In the Works on PolitiFact National’s Trump-O-Meter.) As for the focus of Ryan’s claim, he’s talking about U.S.-based multinational corporations. More specifically, the foreign-earned profits of those companies. Here’s an example of how the taxation works: If the company earns income in a country with a 20 percent corporate tax rate, it would pay that 20 percent tax immediately to that country. If that money is then repatriated -- that is, brought back to the company’s U.S. headquarters -- the company would pay an additional 15 percent to the U.S. government. (In other words, the U.S. tax rate of 35 percent minus the 20 percent already paid to the foreign country.) So, as long as the profits stay parked overseas, there is no U.S. tax on it. Now to the specifics of Ryan’s claim. The $3 trillion figure To back up Ryan’s statement, his office cited an April 2017 CNBC news article that said American companies are holding about $2.6 trillion in overseas earnings, and the figure has been growing. That’s the latest estimate by Congress’ nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, for 2015, although an estimate done in July 2017 for PolitiFact National put the figure at $2.8 trillion. So, Ryan’s claim of about $3 trillion is reasonable. It’s worth noting that the figure has been rising. In fact, considering only the Russell 1000 index of large companies, the amount of parked cash overseas has more than doubled since 2008, as shown in a July 2017 report by the Massachusetts research firm Audit Analytics: Year Amount of foreign-earned profits by U.S.-based companies kept overseas 2008 $1.09 trillion 2009 $1.19 trillion 2010 $1.36 trillion 2011 $1.63 trillion 2012 $1.89 trillion 2013 $2.12 trillion 2014 $2.3 trillion 2015 $2.43 trillion 2016 $2.62 trillion ‘Trapped’ and ‘basically can’t come back’ Ryan asserts that the money is ""trapped overseas"" and ""basically can’t come back"" because of U.S. tax laws To be sure, a substantial amount of foreign profits are repatriated each year. But Ryan didn’t invent the term ""trapped cash."" In fact, academics for years have referred to it as a commonly used term to describe the growing amount of cash held by U.S. multinationals overseas to avoid, or at least defer, paying the 35 percent U.S. tax rate. Ryan’s claim is also backed by September 2017 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan organization in Massachusetts. The paper found a dramatic increase in U.S. corporations holding onto cash; that the cash is concentrated in foreign subsidiaries of multinational corporations; and that it is explained by low foreign tax rates. News articles also have reported on the phenomenon. In August 2016, Apple CEO Tim Cook said of his company’s profits parked offshore: ""We’re not going to bring it back until there’s a fair rate. There’s no debate about it."" Apple is second to Microsoft in the amount of cash parked overseas, according to Audit Analytics. And as the San Jose Mercury News reported in May 2017, the tax is such a deterrent that even though Apple was sitting on $240 billion in overseas cash, it has continued to borrow money. The reason: The borrowing cost Apple 4 percent or less, far below the 35 percent tax that would be paid for repatriating the overseas cash. One more point before we close: The companies would like to repatriate the money because bringing it back to the parent company enables them to do things such as paying dividends, doing stock buybacks and investing in U.S. operations. Several academic experts told us that some of the overseas money, while not repatriated directly back to the companies’ U.S. headquarters, is invested in U.S. securities. That doesn’t trigger the 35 percent tax. Our rating Ryan says: ""We've got about $3 trillion in trapped cash overseas that basically can't come back in this country because of our tax laws."" To avoid a 35 percent U.S. tax, U.S.-based multinational companies have opted not to ""repatriate"" roughly $3 trillion of their foreign profits, a figure that is growing. That is, they don’t bring the money back to their U.S. headquarters, where it can be used for things such as dividend payments or investments in their domestic operations. But the overseas profits aren’t literally trapped and indeed some foreign-earned profits are repatriated, though they are subject to the 35 percent tax. Ryan’s statement is accurate but needs additional information, our definition of Mostly True.",True,True
184,"[Claim]:There were more than 1,200 vaccine-related deaths in the first 90 days of the Pfizer rollout.[Evidences]:Australian social media accounts are sharing an online article that claims Pfizer’s own reporting shows there were more than 1200 vaccine-related deaths in the first three months of its COVID-19 vaccine rollout. But the claim follows a familiar anti-vaccine pattern of using adverse events reports, which cannot be directly attributed to receiving the vaccine, to misrepresent the data, according to experts who spoke to AAP FactCheck . On March 9, the Facebook account for Australian Free Independent Press Network (AFIPN) posted a link to an article hosted on its website by an author called John Napper. The article was headlined, “Pfizer, stranger than fiction”. The article discusses documents a US court ordered the US Food and Drug Administration to release following a Freedom of Information Act request by the group Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency . The article says the first trove of documents revealed that “over 1200 vaccine related deaths occurred within the first 90 days of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine rollout”. That number is in a Pfizer report that analyses data on adverse events reported during the first three months of the Pfizer rollout, up to February 28, 2021. Table 1 (page 7) of the report records 1223 fatalities reported as adverse events during that period. While there is fresh impetus among anti-vaccine groups following the release of the Pfizer documents, such as here , claims about the 1223 figure were first fact-checked in December 2021 following the initial release of documents by the FDA, such as here and here . Those checks point out that nowhere in the Pfizer report does it say the 1223 deaths were linked to the vaccine. Jacques Raubenheimer a senior research fellow in biostatistics at University of Sydney who has written on vaccine misinformation and data misinterpretation , makes the same point. He told AAP FactCheck it was important to heed the report’s warning that an accumulation of adverse event reports did not necessarily indicate that a particular adverse event was caused by the drug. “If we have, as a most conservative estimate, 10 million doses and we have reports from 42,086 cases, then that gives us 0.4 per cent of doses leading to reports, and when we further consider that most of those were not serious, then we suddenly realise that, far from sounding the alarm, this document shows the opposite,” Dr Raubenheimer said in an email. Professor Nigel McMillan , the director of the Infectious Diseases and Immunology Program at Griffith University Queensland, said the claim of 1223 deaths related to the vaccine’s first three month rollout was a common misuse of information. “In any group of people we see deaths from all sorts of things like heart attacks and cancer (450 a day in Australia actually) and some of these people might have been vaccinated in the last month or so. It doesn’t mean those people died because of the vaccine. In Australia, regulator investigation have resulted in 12 vaccine-attributed deaths from 50 million doses given,” Prof McMillan said. A Pfizer spokesman told AAP FactCheck spontaneously reported adverse events (AEs) were collected for all products to monitor for potential safety issues that may not have been seen in clinical studies and the events may not have any causal relationship to the vaccine. “Rather, the event may be due to an underlying disease or some other factor such as past medical history or concomitant medication or the AEs may be coincidental,” the spokesman said. Pfizer said the safety profile for the vaccine for all authorised groups continued to be favourable. A Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) statement to AAP FactCheck said the online article by AFIPN misrepresented the Pfizer report. “The table on page 7 does not indicate that there have been 1223 deaths caused by Comirnaty (the Pfizer vaccine),” the TGA’s emailed statement said. “The Pfizer report, which was provided to the FDA, is an analysis of Pfizer’s safety database, which contains cases of adverse event reports collected by Pfizer up to 28 February 2021 from a range of sources, including a large number from spontaneous reporting systems. “These reports are received from health professionals and consumers who are encouraged to report clinically significant health problems following vaccination, even if they are uncertain about whether the vaccine was the cause. As the Pfizer document notes, reporting of an adverse event, including those with a fatal outcome, does not mean that it was caused by the vaccine. The event may be related to an underlying disease or some other factor such as past medical history or concomitant medication. Simple review of the number and nature of adverse event reports in this document is not a valid method for assessing the safety of the vaccines.” Studies since the early days of the Pfizer vaccine have highlighted its low incidence of serious adverse events, such as here and here . More recently, a CDC-funded study found that data from more than 298 million doses of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine administered in the first six months of the US vaccination program showed that most reported adverse events were mild and short in duration. An AAP FactCheck report on similar misrepresentation of the reporting of adverse events in January 2022 showed that in its COVID-19 vaccine safety report , dated 27 January, the TGA had received and reviewed 755 reports of deaths following vaccinations. Of these, only 11 had been identified as being linked to the vaccines themselves. The Verdict The claim that there were 1223 vaccine-related deaths in the first three months of the Pfizer rollout is false. The claim misrepresents adverse event reporting in Pfizer documents. The figure represents deaths that were reported in the period following someone receiving a vaccination but those deaths are not necessarily linked to the vaccine. The figure is compiled from a variety of medical and non-medical sources. Studies over the past two years have consistently affirmed the mainly mild reactions to the vaccine from millions of doses.

185,"[Claim]:Says ""6 percent more Republicans across the state voted than Democrats.""[Evidences]:Thursday morning was a rough one for Bob Tiernan. Just before Democrat John Kitzhaber accepted the governorship, the chairman of Oregon’s Republican Party had to bat away suggestions that the state GOP was in need of a major makeover.Tiernan was a guest on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s Think Out Loud Thursday morning, and host Emily Harris asked him what was next for the party. ""If Chris Dudley had won, there was a lot of talk that he would be the leader of rebuilding the Oregon Republican Party,"" she said. She then went on to mention the fact that all statewide offices belong to Democrats and that Republicans had been having a difficult time finding candidates for some races.How, Harris asked, would Dudley’s loss affect all that?""First off, the Republican Party is quite strong in this state. I think you can look at our statistics from this last election,"" Tiernan said. ""We outperformed Democrats. ... Six percent more Republicans across the state voted than Democrats.""We wondered whether he had that right.If you take the statement at face value, it sounds as though you had more Republicans than Democrats voting.Thankfully, the Oregon Secretary of State tracks all these numbers.As of 8:30 Thursday morning, the Secretary of State was reporting that roughly 644,000 Democrats and 526,000 Republicans voted out of a total of 1,479,188 for all ballots returned. That means Democrats accounted for about 44 percent of returned ballots and Republicans for about 36 percent. That gives the edge to Democrats.But there’s another way to look at these numbers. While more Democrats than Republicans voted, there are far more Oregon voters registered as Democrats than as Republicans. If you take that into account, the numbers show that 79 percent of all Republicans had turned out to vote while 74.5 of all Democrats had. That is indeed a difference of 6 percent.We spoke with Greg Leo, the spokesman for the Oregon Republican Party, and he told us that Tiernan was referring to the return rates within each party, not overall.So, back to the ruling. Tiernan is right, the Republicans did have a stronger turnout if you’re talking party proportions. But he didn’t make it exactly clear what he meant in his guest spot on ""Think Out Loud,"" and certainly listeners could have come away a bit confused, thinking more Republicans had voted than Democrats.

The post includes a picture of a tractor towing a fighter jet in a street at night. The image spread as thousands of tractor-driving farmers demonstrated in central Netherlands in June 2022, causing widespread traffic chaos as they protested against the government's far-reaching plans to cut nitrogen emissions. The Dutch government intends to cut nitrogen, a greenhouse gas, by as much as 70 percent in 131 key areas -- many of them close to nature reserves -- to reach climate goals by 2030. For farmers, a 40 percent drop in emissions is expected, which would require around 30 percent fewer cattle, according to reports. But the photo shared online was not taken in 2022 -- and it does not come from the Netherlands. A reverse image search revealed that Croatian media outlet Jutarnji list published the picture in a May 26, 2011 article. The daily newspaper reported the photo was taken during preparations for a military weapons display to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the creation of the Croatian armed forces. Local newspaper 24sata published the same photo in a May 26, 2011 report, which said the aircraft was towed through the streets of Zagreb at night ahead of the exhibit in the capital's Jarun district. 24sata published photos of the plane from different angles, one of which is also included in a 2011 release from the Croatian Defense Ministry.

189,"[Claim]:An image shows a five-story building collapsed due to a 7.3 MG earthquake that hit Pakistan on June 22, 2022.[Evidences]:Images depicting damage to buildings caused by earthquakes in Turkey and Haiti were misattributed to the earthquake in Pakistan. Context: On June 22, 2022, the Afghanistan earthquake left people with injuries, casualties, and infrastructure damage. The effect was also observed in Islamabad and other parts of Pakistan. Following this, misleading and fake images were circulated on social media. On June 22, one such post shared two images showing buildings destroyed due to an earthquake and captioned them, ""A massive earthquake of 7.3 MG hit Pakistan today morning, 5 storage building breakdown."" However, the images mentioned are not from Pakistan but Turkey and Haiti. In fact: By conducting a reverse image search of the first picture, we found the exact image of the damaged building from the Boston Globe website. The image caption states, ""Rescue workers tried to dig through a collapsed building on January 06, 2020, in Elazig, Turkey after a 6.8-magnitude earthquake injured more than 1,600 people and left some 30 trapped in the wreckage of toppled buildings."" Therefore, it confirms the image is from Turkey, not from Pakistan. On verifying the second image through reverse search, we found a similar image on United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) USA published the same image on August 14, 2021. It also reports that a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck southwest Haiti on August 14, 2021, causing more property loss and damage. Further, the Hong Kong Red Cross website posted the same image with the caption, ""on August 14, 2021, a 7.2 magnitude earthquake hit Haiti. The earthquake has caused severe damage to infrastructure, including hospitals, especially in Jereme and Les Cayes in the southern part of the country."" According to BBC, an earthquake that occurred on June 22, 2022, killed around a thousand people and injured many in eastern Afghanistan. It also reports that the earthquake hit about 44 km from the city of Khost, and quakes were felt in Pakistan's capital Islamabad, Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, and India.

190,"[Claim]:Rep. Peter Petrarca ""voted on two pieces of legislation that helped auto body shops ... and at that point I think there is a conflict of interest.""[Evidences]:One of the issues that sparked outrage around the State House in June was the last-minute lawmaking on behalf of the auto body shop industry. Around3 a.m.onJune 13, lawmakers approved a bill giving auto body shops the right to sue insurance companies if they couldn't agree on the cost of car repairs. The legislation was pushed by John Petrarca, president of Providence Auto Body, and his daughter, Jina Petrarca-Karampetsos, spokeswoman for the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island. They are the father and sister, respectively, of Rep. Peter J. Petrarca, D-Lincoln, who did not vote on the bill. But insurance company representatives said Representative Petrarca, the House senior deputy majority leader, had lobbied hard for the legislation. Governor Chafee vetoed the bill days later, saying it would hurt consumers by generating lawsuits that ultimately would increase insurance premiums and interfere with customers' contracts with their insurance companies. But Petrarca's challenger in the House District 44 Democratic primary, Gregory J. Costantino, sought to keep Petrarca in the cross hairs of criticism when the two men appeared on ""Newsmakers"" on Channel 12 (WPRI) onAug. 12. Costantino said that while Petrarca might not have voted on this most recent legislation, he had voted on auto shop bills in the past, which Costantino described as a clear conflict of interest. As an example, Costantino referred vaguely to a bill in 2003 and another one in 2010. He gave no specifics about either piece of legislation. In response, Petrarca said: ""I don't know what they do. I don't know what they are."" And then he launched into an unrelated line of incriminations against Costantino. We were curious what legislation Costantino was referring to and whether he was correct in saying that Petrarca - whose law firm represents Providence Auto Body and the Auto Body Association of Rhode Island- had indeed voted for them. In a telephone interview, Costantino identified the two bills in question, amended pieces of legislation that had passed between the House and Senate: 2003 Senate bill 0022 and 2010 Senate bill 2508. The 2003 bill specifies standards for when ""aftermarket"" parts - those that come from a company other than the car manufacturer - can be used in repairs. For instance, it states that if an insurance company orders an auto body shop to use an aftermarket part, the insurance company is responsible for any cost a shop incurs trying to fit that part into place. It also requires the shop to notify the appraiser if the aftermarket part does not restore the car to its original condition. The 2010 bill would make it an unfair claims practice if an insurance company failed to use an independent appraiser -unaffiliated with the repair shop - when vehicle damage exceeded $2,500. We called the State House Library to check the House Journal for the votes of those two bills. The records do indeed show Petrarca voting on both occasions - each time in favor of the bills, which passed. When we called Petrarca, he said he still didn't know what bills his opponent had been talking about, and so we brought him up to speed with what we learned. He was unapologetic. ""Those two bills, those pieces of legislation, do not benefit body shops,"" he said. ""They benefit the consumer."" With the 2003 bill, he said, ""If the shop can prove that the aftermarket part doesn't fit, they [insurance company] have to pay for a new part. ""There is no conflict [of interest] because it doesn't affect body shops. He [Costantino] should get his facts right."" Our ruling GregoryCostantinosaid during a recent ""Newsmakers"" broadcast that Rep. Peter Petrarca had in the past voted for two pieces of auto body shop legislation and therefore his actions amounted to a conflict of interest. The official legislative record shows Petrarca voted on the bills. And considering Petrarca's professional and personal connections to the auto body shop industry, his vote on them posed at least an appearance of conflict of interest. But whether the bills actually help body shops or consumers is debatable. Therefore we rate Costantino's claim:Mostly True.",True,True

The post was tagged in Pennsauken, New Jersey. Trump was not on the ballot in 2018, when midterm elections for Congress took place. US presidents face voters every four years. Newsweek -- along with several other news sources -- published the photo in 2018 and reported that bins of mail were dumped in New Jersey by a Postal Service employee who quit and abandoned the mail. United States Postal Service Office of Inspector General spokeswoman Agapi Doulaveris confirmed over the phone that the mail in the photo was later delivered to the proper recipients. “I cannot say if there are any ballots… I don’t know the mail mix specifically,” Doulaveris said. “All I can say is the mail was delivered.” Mail dumping is not a regular issue in the Postal Service, Doulaveris said. USPS has hundreds of thousands of employees, and “the majority are trustworthy and honest. But if we hear about this, it’s our duty to look into any type of dumping.” As the presidential election approaches and tens of millions of voters opt for mail-in ballots as a safer alternative to in-person voting during the coronavirus pandemic, USPS has been plagued by online misinformation -- much of it driven by Trump himself.

Therefore, COVID-19 can continue to contribute to excess deaths even months after someone has recovered from the initial infection. KEY TAKE AWAY There’s no question that countries in the Western world continued to see excess deaths in 2022, despite COVID-19 vaccines having been introduced in late 2020 to combat the pandemic. Vaccine skeptics have expressed the view that COVID-19 vaccination is to blame for these excess deaths. However, published studies show that vaccinated people aren’t more likely to die than unvaccinated people. This view is therefore inconsistent with the scientific evidence. Various other issues, such as long COVID and strain on healthcare systems, are more plausible explanations for excess mortality. FULL CLAIM: EuroMOMO data shows excess deaths in people aged 0 to 14; “The chief medical officer in the U.K. has said that the excess deaths are caused by people not being able to get their statins during the pandemic, well, most 14-year-olds don't take statins”; “In the times of Omicron, we know that deaths are massively reduced, so we cannot attribute these deaths to Covid. These deaths are caused, or the majority of these deaths are caused, by something other than Covid” REVIEW On 23 January 2023, retired nurse educator John Campbell published a YouTube video commenting on excess mortality data from EuroMOMO, a project monitoring mortality in 29 European countries or subregions, led by scientists at the Statens Serum Institute in Denmark. The video had received more than 540,000 views at the time of this review’s publication. [Editor’s note: Campbell published another video three days after the one reviewed in this publication that repeated some of the same claims.] In the video, Campbell claimed that the EuroMOMO data showed excess mortality in Europe in 2022, with the group aged 0 to 14 as a particular point of interest. He didn’t explicitly claim that COVID-19 vaccination caused these excess deaths, but alluded to it by pivoting towards discussing only deaths based on vaccination status later in the video in relation to excess mortality, although he added that “we’re not saying there’s a connection”. That last line belies Campbell’s track record established by his previous videos, in which he implied that the COVID-19 vaccines are unsafe, as Health Feedback documented in previous reviews. As we will show below, the EuroMOMO website itself contradicts Campbell’s interpretation of its data, and there’s insufficient evidence to support his implication that COVID-19 vaccination is related to excess mortality. EuroMOMO didn’t detect excess deaths in people aged 0 to 14; fewer actual deaths were observed in this group compared to the pre-pandemic period Campbell began to state his case by claiming that EuroMOMO data showed excess death in children aged 0 to 14 years old. However, the EuroMOMO website cautioned that such an interpretation of the data isn’t supported at the moment, due to a statistical artifact that introduced a bias in its baseline estimate of expected deaths. This bias makes the estimated baseline lower, thus creating an appearance of more excess deaths. EuroMOMO concluded by saying that: “the EuroMOMO mortality surveillance system does actually not detect more deaths among the 0 to 14-years old during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic than in the period before the COVID-19 pandemic, even if the cumulated outputs reported on the EuroMOMO website suggest so.” No mention of this caveat was made by Campbell in his video. Furthermore, EuroMOMO reported that there were fewer actual deaths in this age group during 2021 and 2022 than in the pre-pandemic period: “During the COVID-19 pandemic the lock-down period (week 1, 2020 to week 21, 2021) had a mean of 326 deaths per week and the following period (week 22, 2021 to week 40, 2022) had a mean of 345 deaths per week which both are lower than the average of 361 deaths per week observed in the period before the COVID-19 pandemic (week 1, 2018 to week 52, 2019).” EuroMOMO added that it was currently working in order to address the bias in its estimated baseline (expected number of deaths). Without the corrected baseline however, it remains unclear if there are excess deaths in this age group, and if so, how many. Campbell’s claim is premature and misleading by leaving out these important caveats. When contacted about Campbell’s claim, EuroMOMO told Health Feedback that it had no comment on the matter. Health Feedback also reached out to Campbell for comment and will update this review if new information becomes available. Excess deaths are likely due to multiple factors that can vary from country to country; COVID-19 can lead to heart problems even a year after infection There’s no question that many countries in the developed world experienced excess mortality in 2022, and it’s likely that there isn’t a single cause for excess mortality in all countries. Health Feedback delved into several possible explanations for this persistent excess mortality, including COVID-19, summer heatwaves in Europe in 2022, and healthcare crises. For Campbell however, citing Europe-wide data on excess death from EuroMOMO served as a springboard for discrediting U.K. public health officials and their explanations for excess deaths specifically in the U.K. According to Campbell, Chris Whitty, the chief medical officer for England, had said that all excess deaths occurred in people who were unable to obtain statins, a type of medicine used to lower cholesterol levels and treat cardiovascular disease. Campbell then remarked that “well, most 14-year-olds don’t take statins”. But this is a strawman that misrepresents what Whitty said. Media reports, like those of The Times and The Telegraph, show that Witty was referring to a proportion of excess deaths due to cardiovascular disease, not to all excess deaths, when discussing people not getting statins when they needed it. And deaths related to heart problems did contribute to the largest proportion of excess deaths in the U.K. in 2022, based on data from the U.K. Office for Health Improvement and Disparities (see Figure 1 below), which explains Whitty’s concern. Figure 1. Excess mortality in England by cause of death. The left panel shows excess deaths categorized based on cause of death, which involves “any mention of the cause on the death certificate” and may not be the underlying cause. The right panel shows the ratio of registered deaths to expected deaths categorized based on cause. IHD: ischemic heart disease, ARI: acute respiratory infections, CLRD: cirrhosis and other liver diseases. Data retrieved on 28 January 2023. Source: Office for Health Improvement and Disparities. Campbell’s video conspicuously didn’t mention that the U.K.’s healthcare system is currently facing a series of crises, including a lack of funding and staff, resulting in significant delays in care. Delays in urgent care have been estimated to cause between 300 to 500 deaths a week, the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine told The Guardian at the beginning of January 2023. The BBC reported that “In November, for example, it took 48 minutes on average for an ambulance in England to respond to a suspected heart attack or stroke, compared to a target of 18 minutes.” A report by the House of Lords Public Service Committee on the state of emergency healthcare, published on 19 January 2023, described it as a “national emergency”. These are just a few of the ways in which delays in care manifested, noted in the report: “In the West Midlands, the number of people dying waiting for ambulances has risen from one in 2020 to 37 between January and September 2022” “In October 2019, just 2% of patients handed over from ambulances to A&E [Accident and Emergency] waited over an hour. In October 2022, it was 18%: 52,000 patients” “In October 2022, 45% of patients waited longer than four hours in A&E” Given these challenges in obtaining medical care in the U.K., it isn’t a stretch to imagine that many people are dying when they normally wouldn’t have, leading to a rise in excess deaths. Contrary to Campbell’s claim that COVID-19 cannot explain excess mortality in 2022, there’s evidence suggesting otherwise. Studies found that catching COVID-19 increases a person’s risk of developing cardiovascular disease even months after recovering from the initial infection. One study that looked at more than 150,000 U.S. veterans reported that the increased cardiovascular risk persisted at least a year after a person had COVID-19[1]. Some of the problems the researchers observed were stroke, heart inflammation, blood clotting disorders, and dysrhythmias (heart rhythm problems). However, one of the drawbacks of this study is that the study population (army veterans) may not be representative of the general population in the U.S. A study in the U.K. general population also observed a higher risk of cardiovascular problems in people who had COVID-19 compared to those who didn’t[2]. These problems included stroke, heart inflammation, blood clotting disorders, and heart failure. Another study in the U.K. general population, which included more than 17,000 people, observed similar problems in those who had COVID-19, although the risk of different cardiovascular problems varied depending on how much time had passed since the infection as well as the severity of COVID-19[3]. The researchers found that the risk was greatest shortly after infection. And those who’d had severe COVID-19 (hospitalized) had a greater risk for all of the cardiovascular events measured in the study, including stroke and blood clotting disorders. Those who’d had mild COVID-19 (not hospitalized) had a higher risk of blood clots but not for other problems. The study also reported that people who had mild COVID-19 had a “10-fold greater risk of all-cause death” compared to uninfected people, which further reinforces the explanation of COVID-19 as a contributing factor for excess deaths. Insufficient evidence for suspecting COVID-19 vaccination as the cause of excess deaths As a medical intervention that’s relatively new and was introduced widely in 2021, some social media commentators consider the COVID-19 vaccines as the likely explanation for excess deaths in 2022. But apart from the simplistic correlation of vaccination occurring before the persistence of excess deaths in 2022 (a fallacy known as post hoc ergo propter hoc), a more rigorous examination of the data doesn’t support this explanation. For starters, studies didn’t find that vaccinated people are more likely to die compared to unvaccinated people. One such example is a CDC study examining the period between December 2020 and July 2021[4]. Another study, published in the journal JAMA Network, looked at excess mortality in the U.S. and other peer countries between June 2021 and March 2022. It reported that excess all-cause mortality was greater in the ten least-vaccinated states than in the ten most-vaccinated states[5]. Another study in the state of Indiana, which included more than 520,000 people, compared vaccinated people with unvaccinated, previously infected people. The study found that all-cause mortality was 37% lower in the vaccinated group[6]. Further reinforcing this finding, the researchers reported that the unvaccinated group had a 24% and 37% higher rate of all-cause emergency department visits and hospitalization compared to the vaccinated group, respectively, underscoring the benefits of vaccination. Conclusion There’s no question that countries in the Western world continued to see excess deaths in 2022, despite COVID-19 vaccines having been introduced in late 2020 to combat the pandemic. Vaccine skeptics have expressed the view that COVID-19 vaccination is to blame for these excess deaths, but published studies show that vaccinated people aren’t more likely to die than unvaccinated people. This view is therefore inconsistent with the scientific evidence. Moreover, we have evidence supporting other more plausible explanations, which vaccine skeptics ignore. One of these is COVID-19 itself. Getting COVID-19 is associated with both short-term and long-term risks of developing health problems, such as cardiovascular disorders, even after the person recovers from the initial infection. Therefore, a proportion of excess deaths that occurred in 2022 may well be the result of COVID-19’s long-term effects making themselves felt. Another problem is the strain on healthcare services, which may vary from country to country. Notably, the U.K.’s public health system continues to be under severe strain at the time of publication, leading to delays in people getting urgent care. That a failing healthcare system resulted in many needless deaths in the U.K. is hardly a controversial explanation, but it’s one that Campbell never mentioned. Despite the picture painted by Campbell of “governments and mainstream media ignoring the huge amount of excess deaths”, the fact is that excess deaths in Europe and the U.K. aren’t a closely guarded secret, as media reports by the BBC, Bloomberg, Reuters, and Forbes show. Excess mortality in 2022 is likely the result of a complex interplay of multiple factors rather than a single overarching cause, and disentangling the contribution of each factor towards excess mortality is challenging. The data that we do have point towards a few plausible explanations for excess mortality, but COVID-19 vaccination isn’t one of them. UPDATE (31 January 2023): The review was updated to indicate that EuroMOMO had no comment regarding Campbell’s claim. CORRECTION (31 January 2023): The last name of the chief medical officer of England was misspelled as “Witty”. It should be “Whitty”. We have corrected this error. UPDATE (30 January 2023): This review was updated to add in the first paragraph that Campbell published another video three days after the one reviewed in this publication which repeated some of the same claims.

Citing the offences listed under Sections 427 and 2/3 of the Public Property Act 1985, it says that individuals can be imprisoned for three years. The offences include damaging mosque property, obstructing mosque functioning or operations, staff, or intimidating any member affiliated with the mosque. The offences are categorised as non-bailable. The image is widespread on Facebook and Twitter with the claim that the change has been brought about by the Rajasthan government.

Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 The Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act came into effect in 1984. However, the notice has erroneously written ‘1985’. The Act has provisions that cover punishment for causing damage to public property. According to the Act, public property is defined as any property which is owned by, or in the possession of, or under the control of the Central Government; any State government; any local authority; any corporation established by or under any Central, Provincial or State Act; any company or any institution. Damage to this property is punishable by imprisonment of at least one year or a fine. There is also a provision for bail in this legislation. The Act talks about punishing offenders for causing damage to any public property, not just mosques. 2. IPC Section 427 As per Section 427, individuals who commit mischief and thereby cause loss or damage to the amount of Rs 50 or more would be punished under this section with a jail term which may extend to two years and/or a fine. How are laws framed? The Legislative Assembly has the power to draft laws on 66 subjects in the State List. Apart from this, it can also introduce legislation on 47 subjects on the Concurrent List. However, these cannot be in contradiction with laws made by the Parliament. In such cases, only the law made by the Parliament would be in effect. Any bill passed by the State government is sent to the governor and passed after his approval. There have been no reports on such a bill being introduced or any such Act being passed in the Rajasthan Assembly. Neither is there any information to corroborate the claims in the viral image on the Rajasthan Legislative Assembly website. The Criminal Laws (Rajasthan Amendment) Act 2021 was recently introduced in the Assembly. Rajasthan government debunks viral notice Lokesh Sharma, OSD to Rajasthan’s Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot, clarified that the image is fake. Rajasthan police also posted a tweet denying the claims in circulation. A fake image was, therefore, circulated on social media with the false claim that the Rajasthan government amended Sections 427 of the IPC and 2/3 of the Public Property Act 1985 in order to protect mosques/madrasas.

198,"[Claim]:“The average hospital stay for a case of COVID-19 costs about $17,064. The vaccine is free.”[Evidences]:To encourage people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., posted a comparison between the cost of a hospital stay and the vaccine. ""The average hospital stay for a case of COVID-19 costs about $17,064. The vaccine is free,"" said Jayapal in her Aug. 30 Instagram post. A post shared by Pramila Jayapal (@repjayapal) It’s true that all three COVID-19 vaccines available in the U.S. are free to recipients. We wanted to know if Jayapal was correct about the average cost for a hospital stay for COVID-19 patients. Health policy and industry experts said the $17,064 figure sounds about right, based on available data. But they also noted that figuring out an ""average"" cost for a hospital stay is tricky due to varying factors among patients. The cost of COVID-19 care can vary widely depending on someone’s age, location, length of stay at the hospital, the hospital where they receive care, severity of illness and comorbidities. Whether someone has no insurance, commercial health insurance, Medicaid or Medicare also plays a role. ""Pinning down an average is hard because for everyone who ended up on a ventilator for weeks, costing millions, there are also people who are in and out of (the) hospital in a day or two once they stabilize,"" said Niall Brennan, president and CEO of the Health Care Cost Institute, a nonprofit that compiles claims data and offers research on health care costs and utilization. As backup for Jayapal’s claim, her office sent us an Aug. 26 report from ABC Action News in Tampa. The report said, ""No set amount has been found to be a solid average cost. But the numbers hover between $15-25,000 or more."" The news station cited FAIR Health, a nonprofit focused on health costs and health insurance transparency, as a source. FAIR Health analyzed national data from January to May 2020, near the start and first peak of the pandemic, to assess the costs of hospitalization for a COVID-19 patient. FAIR Health highlighted the median — the middle point — for two different measures of cost: the charge amount, which is the amount charged to a patient who is uninsured or obtaining an out-of-network service; and the allowed amount, which is the total fee negotiated between an insurance plan and a provider for an in-network service. The allowed amount includes both the insurer’s and the member’s share of the total fee. The median charge amount for a COVID-19 hospitalization ranged from $34,662 for patients ages 23 to 30, to $45,683 for people ages 51 to 60, according to FAIR Health. The median estimated allowed amounts ranged from $17,094 for people over 70 to $24,012 for people ages 51 to 60. Jayapal used the lowest number as an example of the cost of a hospitalization due to COVID-19, her spokesperson said. The FAIR Health estimates for the median hospitalization cost are in line with what we found from other sources. An Aug. 20 brief about unvaccinated COVID-19 hospitalizations from the Peterson Center on Healthcare and Kaiser Family Foundation said various sources suggest an average hospitalization cost of around $20,000. The brief pointed to estimates from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which said that the average Medicare fee-for-service COVID-19 hospitalization cost was $24,033. (CMS said its data was preliminary.) The Peterson-KFF report said that another study of Medicare fee-for-service enrollees pegged the average cost at $21,752. According to that study, the mean cost was higher if the patient died in the hospital ($32,015) and was highest if the patient needed ventilator support ($49,441). Researchers also said there were racial and ethnic disparities in costs related to COVID-19. ""Racial and ethnic minority patients incurred higher medical costs than non-Hispanic white patients, and non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic patients accounted for disproportionately high numbers of hospitalizations requiring ventilator support and inpatient deaths,"" the study said. The American Hospital Association referred us to the Peterson-KFF August brief. ""It’s important to note that these reflect averages, and that there is significant variation — for example, some hospitalizations were as much as $80,000 for patients who had prolonged (intensive care unit) stays,"" said Thomas Jordan, a spokesperson for the trade group. Exactly how much a person will end up paying out-of-pocket for a hospitalization also depends on multiple factors. For those with health insurance, that can depend on the type of plan they have. Early in the pandemic, commercial insurers waived cost sharing for COVID-19 treatment, so those individuals might not pay any of the cost, said Ellen Meara, a professor of health economics and policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. However, people with high deductibles in their private insurance plan, and Medicare-insured individuals can face high out-of-pocket costs — often in the thousands of dollars — due to cost sharing, she said. Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian said that unvaccinated employees enrolled in Delta’s account-based healthcare plan will be subject to a $200 monthly surcharge beginning Nov. 1, ""to address the financial risk the decision to not vaccinate is creating for our company.""

199,"[Claim]:Fake: US Lost 90% of Its Weapons Supplied to Ukraine[Evidences]:This was stated by an ex-employee of the CIA, who worked for the agency until 2015, and at the moment is an avid opponent of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. The Pentagon has made no such statements. Such “losses” are not confirmed by the inspections that the US Defense Department of Defense periodically conducts in Ukraine. Kremlin media write that the United States allegedly lost 90% of the US weapons supplied to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. This “sensational statement” was made by former CIA officer Bryan Dean Wright on FirstTV. Tsargrad quotes Wright as saying, “This is according to the Pentagon. They did a little research on the ground, figuring out where the weapons went. 10% can be confirmed to be in Ukraine. The other 90%, we can only hope so.” There is no way Bryan Wright could have access to “declassified” Pentagon data, as he has long had nothing to do with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). According to his Linkedin profile , Wright worked for the CIA first from 2001 to 2006 and then from 2013 to 2015. He is currently the host of his podcast, “President’s Daily Brief,” in which he expresses his opinions on US domestic and foreign policy, often criticizing current US President Joe Biden. Brian Wright also periodically appears on national American channels, as a “former CIA officer” commenting on various events. As for Ukraine, Wright previously spoke against its support and arms transfers and called Russia “a great war machine.” His words were repeatedly used by Russian propaganda channels. Appearing on FirstTV,  Wright repeated the same thing that he said on other platforms – that the US supposedly knows only about the fate of 10% of the weapons that were sent to Ukraine,  as for the rest – “fingers crossed they don’t end up in the wrong hands.” Nevertheless, his opinion is not some “declassification of data” or a Pentagon position, because, again, Wright has nothing to do with the U.S. Defense Department. Officially, the U.S DOD has not made any such statements. For its part, the Pentagon conducts inspections to check weapons storage sites “whenever and wherever the security conditions allow,” and in October, a senior US Defense Department official told Reuters on condition of anonymity that the Ukrainian government has made a commitment to secure and account for the weapons, and there is no credible evidence that the DOD were deceived. Russian propaganda has repeatedly tried to find evidence that Western arms supplied to Ukraine are allegedly stolen and sold off to other countries, but each time such lies have failed.

202,"[Claim]:""In 2010 there were 195,000 members of SAPS and now there are 176,000.""[Evidences]:The numbers cited by Cele for 2010 are largely correct – there were just under 194,000 SAPS officers, close to Cele's ""195,000"", making for a police to population ratio of 1:258. But the minister exaggerated how many police officers left the force during the 2010s, by between 6,000 and 12,000 officers, depending on whether admin staff are included in the estimate or not. Despite the concerning decline in the number of SAPS staff, this and police-population ratios are only one way of measuring police capacity, experts say, and may not be the best focus for reducing crime. With crime statistics from April to June 2022 showing increases in multiple crime categories, South Africa's policing system has been under sharp scrutiny. The police minister and multiple news articles have pointed to declining police numbers as a major issue. In a press briefing in August minister Bheki Cele cited statistics that suggested the South African Police Service (SAPS) had a marked decline in employee numbers over the past decade. ""In 2010 we had 195,000 members of the South African Police Service … Today we have 176,000."" Cele rounded up by a thousand and said this equalled 20,000 fewer SAPS members in 2022 than in 2010. The minister also claimed that while in 2010 the ratio of police to population was one officer for every 250 people, in 2022 the ratio was just one officer to 450 people. In Cele's view, the decline in police numbers meant the country was suffering a ""shortage"" of police, which needed to be ""corrected"". But are his numbers accurate? And how much do they matter in the grand scheme of things? We looked into it. The minister's spokesperson, Lirandzu Themba, told Africa Check the statistics had been taken from SAPS's annual reports. For the period 1 April 2010 to 31 March 2011, there were 193,892 SAPS members. A discrepancy of a little over 1,000 could be taken as generous rounding up (from 193,892 to Cele's 195,000 count), but Cele is off by a greater margin with the more recent data. Cele claimed that there were 176,000 SAPS members in 2022. But according to the 2020/21 SAPS annual report, which is the latest available data , there were 182,126 members at the end of the financial year. In previous statements, Cele has left out administrative staff when citing  SAPS employment statistics. But even with these staff excluded, Cele's numbers are off. Excluding administrative employees, SAPS reported 160,540 personnel in 2010/11 and 148,060 in 2020/21. Africa Check asked Cele's spokesperson about this discrepancy, but did not receive a response. Police decline largely due to staff promotion patterns By either set of figures, what is true is that the number of SAPS members is in decline. Africa Check spoke to Gareth Newham , head of the Justice and Violence Prevention Programme at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) and an expert on policing in South Africa. He said that the decline in police numbers is largely a result of a change in promotion policy at SAPS. The ISS is a non-profit organisation that aims to improve human security on the continent. Newham and his colleagues recently analysed SAPS data from 2012 to 2020, tracking key trends in the force's performance, budget and personnel over time. They reported that lower-ranking SAPS personnel like sergeants and warrant officers now ""receive promotions every four years regardless of their performance"". According to Newham, in 2018 and 2019 more than 42,000 personnel were promoted, increasing the salary bill by R1.2 billion ""without improvements in activities or performance"". The decline in police numbers was not a result of insufficient funding, according to Newham. In fact, between 2012 and 2020, the SAPS budget increased by 65.5%, from R58.5 billion to R96.8 billion. But due largely to the effect of automatic promotions on the salary bill, SAPS could afford 6% fewer personnel in that period. This meant that staff lost due to natural attrition, for example leaving the SAPS to retire or because of personal reasons, could less readily be replaced. Newham said that because most of the SAPS budget was spent on salaries, ""the policy of automatic mass promotions has meant they've had to cut personnel costs resulting in fewer officers"". He also told Africa Check there had been an increase in personnel leaving SAPS, often ""due to dissatisfaction with working conditions from 2012 onwards"". Since 2020 the situation had been compounded by government budget cuts and Covid-related issues, he said. Cele said at the press briefing that more officers would be recruited in 2022. ""This year they've given us 10,000 recruits that are at the colleges as we speak. They will be released come December … They've promised to give us another 10,000 next year."" Newham said that this recruitment ""will help somewhat to address the reductions in personnel"" Cele also cited statistics for police-to-population ratios in South Africa. These ratios are a basic indication of how many people in the country one police officer serves. They are calculated by dividing a country's total population in a given year by the number of employed police in that year. For example, if a community has one police officer serving 100 people, the ratio is 1:100. At the press briefing Cele claimed that the police-to-population ratio in 2010 was one police officer serving 250 people, and that the force had been spread so thinly that the 2022 ratio was more like one officer to 450 people. Africa Check calculated the ratios of police to population using SAPS annual reports and Statistics South Africa 's mid-year population estimates for 2010 and 2020 . If administrative staff are included when calculating the ratio, Cele is almost correct about the 2010 numbers, with one officer to 258 people. If administrative staff are excluded, the ratio is one officer to 311 people. Administrative staff ""provide strategic leadership, management and support services"" to the SAPS. They are often excluded from police-to-population ratio calculations as they are not police officers permitted to search, arrest and perform other duties ""on the ground"" for the country's population. Cele's ratio for 2022 is less accurate. Instead of 1:450 as claimed, the ratio is one officer to 327 people. Even when admin staff are excluded, Cele's ratio is still exaggerated – it is then one officer to 403 people. But the focus on police to population ratios may be misguided, experts have previously told Africa Check. Although often seen as an international benchmark for the functioning of an effective police force, experts say that in reality performance likely has little to do with these ratios. Cele has cited such ratios before , with varying accuracy , despite experts concluding that there is little evidence for any recommended ratio. 'It's not about numbers, it's about strategy,' says policing expert According to Gareth Newham of the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) , numbers of police or police-to-population ratios are not the most relevant indicators. ""It's not about numbers, it's about strategy; it's about having a clear crime plan,"" he told Africa Check. Newham pointed to the performance of the Gauteng province SAPS from 2009 to 2011 as an example. With ""a clear strategy and a relatively small number of dedicated resources"", including only around 400 officers out of the 34,000 in the province, the force managed to reduce hijacking by a third, home robberies by 20% and robberies of businesses by 19%. According to the ISS, this strategy was based on research into successful crime reduction efforts from the United States and Colombia. It involved ""focused intelligence"" from detective task teams that gathered evidence and ensured there was an increase in reporting robbery cases to the National Prosecuting Authority . The result was, according to the ISS, that ""the number of convictions in these crimes increased, and the number of robberies fell"".",False,True

The viral post claims, ""This is Coconut peel, for typhoid or to boost your blood, dry it very well with sun and cook it with a pinch of potash, drink a cup morning and night."" Typhoid fever is a bacterial infection that can spread throughout the body, affecting many organs. Without prompt treatment, it can cause serious complications and can be fatal. Before trying out such home remedies that can be fatal and potentially cause harm to your health you should always consult a doctor and seek medical supervision. Does coconut coir actually help? Let's find out. Fact Check According to an article in The Guardian, ""Typhoid fever can be life-threatening if it is not detected and treated at the early stages. With early treatment, typhoid fever usually resolves within two to four weeks without any form of complications."" It also mentions some of the natural ways to control fever in uncomplicated cases such as fever plant (Ocimum gratissimum), lemon grass (Cymbopogon citrates), Nigeria senna (Cassia occidentalis), neem (Azadirachta indica), local catnip (Solenostemun monostachyus), etc., to help lower the high body temperature, especially in children. The article also says that an infusion or decoction of any of the herbs can be given as a retention enema to help cleanse the bowels and further lower the body temperature. An article by Healthline states, ""Drinking plenty of water is also important. However, since typhoid fever is caused by bacterial contamination, if you're in an area in which typhoid fever is common, choose bottled water and avoid drinks with ice — unless the ice is made from bottled or boiled water."" Basically, typhoid is a type of bacterial infection that's usually transmitted via the consumption of food and water contaminated with Salmonella typhi. The World Health Organisation suggests people being treated for typhoid fever do the following: Take prescribed antibiotics for as long as the doctor has prescribed. Wash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom, and do not prepare or serve food for other people. This will lower the chance of passing the infection on to someone else. Have their doctor test to ensure that no Salmonella Typhi bacteria remain in their body. We could not find any scientific proof that says coconut coir can help treat typhoid. We found no studies that back the unheard benefits of coconut coir in treating typhoid. NewsMeter advises people to rush to a health expert if they notice any symptoms like fever, diarrhoea, headache, and vomiting, etc. Typhoid could be fatal if you continuously ignore the worsening complications while trying out such bogus home remedies. Hence, the claim is false.",False,False
205,"[Claim]:“We spent billions on a border wall and quit when it was 90% finished.”[Evidences]:A Facebook post claims that construction of a southern border wall stopped just before completion. It’s highly misleading. ""We spent billions on a border wall and quit when it was 90% finished,"" said a March 23 Facebook post, which included a photo claiming to show people streaming through an opening at the border. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) President Joe Biden on his first day in office issued a proclamation to pause construction on the southern border and to assess the legality of the funding and construction contracts. Critics of the Biden administration say his policies are encouraging people to migrate illegally to the U.S. But the post fails to account for some important facts. Among them is that former President Donald Trump routinely moved the goal post regarding how many miles of border wall he wanted to build. Most of the construction that happened under his presidency involved the replacement of old barriers with new fencing that’s expected to be more effective in stopping illegal immigration. And experts have said that the border barriers are not a significant factor in the current migration surge. ""The amount of wall that would have been built between January and now is negligible and would have practically no effect on how many people are crossing the border,"" Nicole Hallett, director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago Law School, recently told PolitiFact North Carolina. As a presidential candidate, Trump repeatedly said that the nearly 2,000-mile southern border needed a wall only along 1,000 miles. Natural barriers took care of the rest, he said. After his election, Trump offered varying estimates on the length of the wall and how many miles needed protection. He lowered projections the longer he was in office. ""You’ll need anywhere from 700 to 900 miles,"" he said in July 2017. ""We are going to do about 537 miles altogether,"" he said in July 2020. About a week before he left office — with about 450 miles of barriers completed — Trump claimed to have ""completed the wall."" ""And today, we celebrate an extraordinary milestone, the completion of the promised 450 miles of border wall, 450 miles,"" Trump said Jan. 12. He claimed that an additional 300 miles were ""either in construction or pre-construction."" Trump’s inconsistent statements make it tough to measure his success. But we did not find a way to get to 90% completion, regardless of the metric used. Trump’s talk of a border wall commonly gave the impression that no barriers existed at the southern border and that he would build a wall along hundreds of unprotected miles. That’s not what happened. The Trump administration is responsible for about 7% of the approximately 700 miles of primary barriers now in place on the southern border. When Trump entered office, the southern border had 654 miles of primary barriers — fencing to stop people on foot and in vehicles. By the time he left, that increased by 52 miles, to 706 miles of primary barriers. U.S. Customs and Border Protection said that since January 2017, officials had ""identified"" about $15 billion for about 738 miles of border projects. As of late January 2021, crews had completed work on about 458 miles of those 738 miles (mainly replacement projects). So even by that metric, overall construction was not ""90% finished"" by the time Trump left office. Here’s a breakdown of what construction crews had done by late January: Replaced 351 miles of outdated and/or dilapidated primary barriers; Replaced 22 miles of outdated and/or dilapidated secondary barriers; Installed 52 miles of primary barriers in places where no barriers previously existed; Installed 33 miles of secondary barriers in places where no barriers previously existed. Despite Trump’s promise, Mexico did not pay for the construction. Funding for the projects came from the U.S. departments of Homeland Security and Defense, and the Treasury Forfeiture Fund, CBP said. A Facebook post said, ""We spent billions on a border wall and quit when it was 90% finished."" Contracts for construction at the southern border total billions of dollars, and Biden has directed a pause in construction. That’s not in dispute. But construction was not 90% finished. In addition, most of the work completed under the Trump administration involved the replacement of older barriers. The post contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",Conflicting,False

Become a Founding Member to help us hire more fact-checkers. And, please, follow the CDC or WHO for guidance on protecting your community from the disease. On April 26, 2020, Rudy Giuliani, a former New York City mayor and a staunch ally of U.S. President Donald Trump, purportedly tweeted to criticize the Obama administration for supposedly having given “$3.7 million to the Wuhab lab in China” in 2017 — the site where the COVID-19 coronavirus originated, according to unfounded rumor, or “was created,” according to conspiracy theory. Some critics were quick to point out that former President Barack Obama was only president for less than three weeks in 2017, as Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 2017, so Giuliani was effectively criticizing Trump himself: The above screenshot did reproduce a real tweet from Giuliani. And given that U.S. government funding is typically proposed, approved, budgeted, and appropriated long before it is actually disbursed, Giuliani’s reference to the year 2017 wasn’t necessarily as much of a gaffe as it might have superficially appeared. The former mayor still managed to get plenty wrong in a single tweet, however. As we noted in a previous article here on Snopes.com, the referenced $3.7 million comprised a series of multiple grants for coronavirus research issued by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases over the course of several years to different entities, of which the Wuhan Institute of Virology was just one: Between 2014 and 2019, the EcoHealth Alliance was awarded a series of grants totaling approximately $3.7 million by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (a division of the National Institutes of Health) to study the “risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife using in-depth field investigations across the human-wildlife interface in China.” Only a portion of this money has been used to fund research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, however, and approximately $700,000 of this grant money was awarded under the Trump administration. Under award number NIAID R01AI110964, NIH also funded studies produced by institutions in the United States, Australia, and Singapore, and the work involving the Wuhan Institute of Virology was an international collaboration with the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance. While these funds were originally appropriated by the NIH in 2014 during the Obama administration, the most recent payment, in 2019, was authorized by the Trump administration. Furthermore, such grants were not “prohibited” in 2014. As noted above, the grants questioned by Giuliani were to study the “risk of future coronavirus (CoV) emergence from wildlife.” Back in October 2014, the U.S. had placed a funding moratorium on one specific type of research, gain-of-function (GOF) studies that have “the potential to enhance the pathogenicity or transmissibility of potential pandemic pathogens” and had “raised biosafety and biosecurity concerns, including the potential dual use risks associated with the misuse of the information or products resulting from such research”: Concerns over so-called “gain-of-function” (GOF) studies that make pathogens more potent or likely to spread in people erupted in 2011, when [virologist Yoshihiro] Kawaoka’s team and Ron Fouchier’s lab at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, announced that they had modified the H5N1 bird flu virus to enable it to spread between ferrets. Such studies could help experts prepare for pandemics, but pose risks if the souped-up pathogen escapes the lab. After a long discussion, the National Science Advisory Board for Biosecurity (NSABB) decided the two studies should be published and federal officials issued new oversight rules for certain H5N1 studies. But U.S. officials grew uneasy after the publication of new GOF papers and several accidents in U.S. biocontainment labs. In October 2014, they announced an unprecedented “pause” on funding for 21 GOF studies of influenza, MERS, and severe acute respiratory syndrome viruses. NIH eventually exempted some studies found to pose relatively little risk. But eight influenza studies and three MERS projects remained on hold. The coronavirus research funded between 2014 and 2019 via the grants referenced by Giuliani did not encompass gain-of-function studies and was therefore not “prohibited.” (The gain-of-function funding moratorium was finally lifted in December 2017.) New York’s former mayor was correct in noting that the Wuhan Institute of Virology did receive some research funding via grants from the NIH, but he erred in all the other details stated or implied in his tweet.",False,Conflicting

Let’s fact-check the claim made in the post. The archived version of this post can be found here Claim: After the recent election victory, Mamata Banerjee issued orders to shut down 125 RSS-affiliated schools in West Bengal. Fact: This is three years old news. West Bengal government back in 2018 decided to ban 125 RSS-affiliated schools that do not have a no-objection certificate. Multiple news agencies reported the news back then. Hence the claim made in the post is MISLEADING. As it is evident from the image in the post that the news is from Republic TV, YouTube search with relevant keywords yielded the original news report on Republic TV’s official YouTube channel which was published back in 2018. In this report, we can hear Partha Chatterjee, West Bengal state education minister saying that the government has identified 125 schools affiliated to RSS operating without a no-objection certificate and the government has decided to act on these schools. Further Google search yielded multiple 2018 news articles which have reported this particular news. One such news article by Scroll quoted the State Education Minister Partha Chatterjee saying “We gathered inputs and found that over 125 schools, mostly in north Bengal, did not take any NoC from us and yet, they were in operation. We had told them that they cannot”. This article further reported that Partha Chaterjee had told the state Assembly that ‘the state government reportedly received complaints against 500 such schools, 493 of which are under the scanner’. Hindustan Times has also reiterated the same thing and further reported that Partha Chatterjee told journalists outside the assembly that “RSS or nor RSS, schools have to follow certain norms wielding sticks cannot be taught. We are looking into each case that is being brought to our notice.” From all this, it is evident that this piece of news is three years old and has been revived in the present context of post poll violence incidents in West Bengal.

It is true that President Donald Trump's personal attorney Rudy Giuliani recently traveled to Ukraine to investigate alleged corruption by the former vice president and his son. But there is no criminal trial or indictment against Biden in which witnesses would be called, in either Ukraine or the United States. In fact, several of the details in the story are completely invented: the Uke City Police Force does not exist, there are no piranhas in rivers outside of South America and there is no River Ukraine. Additionally, the two men alleged to have been found dead in the river, named as Wladimir Klitschko and Joseph Conrad, are the same names as a famous Ukrainian boxer and the famed author of ""Heart of Darkness.""

209,"[Claim]:Says 1 in 5 Texans did not have health insurance coverage before the pandemic, and now “nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don’t have access to health care insurance.”[Evidences]:After a primary campaign extended by the coronavirus, MJ Hegar was selected by Democratic voters in Texas to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in November. Hegar celebrated her primary election win with a virtual victory party hosted on Facebook, with appearances from state officials and members of the Texas Democratic Party. During the event, Hegar talked about the coronavirus and its impact in Texas, stating that ""we had a health care crisis in this state before COVID-19."" ""Before the pandemic, nearly 1 in every 5 was without access to health care coverage,"" Hegar said. ""And now: 1 in 3. Nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don’t have access to health care insurance because of the record unemployment and because of our health care model that is failing Texas."" Texas consistently ranks as the state with the highest uninsured rates, but is Hegar right about the number of people without insurance coverage during the coronavirus pandemic? Pre-pandemic insurance levels Hegar’s campaign shared multiple news articles about Texans without health insurance published before and during the pandemic, including recent reporting from the Houston Chronicle highlighting how job losses are leading to a growing population of uninsured Texans. Let’s start with the rate of uninsured Texans before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The Kaiser Health Foundation, a nonprofit health policy research organization, publishes state health facts using detailed data from the Census Bureau, including the insurance status of people under 65 in Texas. More than 4.8 million people under 65 are uninsured — about 19.9% of the population that age, or about 1 in 5 people, according to the latest Census Bureau data published in 2019. Of those Texans who are insured, about 66% are covered through their employer and 21.6% are covered by Medicaid. Texas is one of 13 states that has not expanded Medicaid coverage under the Affordable Care Act, which allows people between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (considered middle class) to receive tax credits to offset the cost of insurance plans purchased through an online marketplace. The act also grants free coverage under Medicaid to anyone earning less than 138% of the federal poverty level (which this year is $26,200 for a family of four) in states that have opted to expand the program. Since Texas has not expanded the program, eligibility requirements for the program are more strict and are not based solely on income. In order to qualify, a person must have an annual income below a certain threshold ($51,876 for a family of four) and be pregnant, be a parent or caretaker of children, have a disability or a family member with a disability or be 65 years or older. Pandemic insurance levels Since Texas first shut down segments of the economy to stop the spread of the coronavirus, the unemployment rate has fluctuated, spiking to a record 13.5% in April before falling to 8.6% in June. For comparison, in June of 2019 the unemployment rate in Texas was 3.4%. As people lost their jobs, many also lost their health insurance coverage. The actual calculation of the number of people without coverage is a moving target, as people find new jobs or secure coverage elsewhere after becoming unemployed. But two national studies show that between 650,000 and 1.6 million Texans could have lost coverage since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. In May, the Kaiser Health Foundation released a report estimating the number of people losing job-based health insurance coverage during the pandemic and how many of those individuals are eligible for coverage through Medicaid or through the Affordable Care Act’s marketplace tax credits. Nationally, the report estimates that as many as 26.8 million people will become uninsured, including workers, adult dependents and children. Of those, the report estimates that half are eligible for coverage through Medicaid and others through tax credits. In Texas, that report estimates that 1.6 million people will lose insurance coverage, which would bring the state’s uninsured rate to about 26.5% for people under 65 — or about 1 in 4 people without health insurance coverage. But these figures don’t speak exactly to Hegar’s claim, which is about the number of people who ""don’t have access to insurance."" Even though Texas has opted not to expand Medicaid coverage to people with incomes below the poverty line, the report states that unemployment benefits and the temporary $600 weekly payments approved by Congress are likely to push annual income for many of these unemployed workers to levels that would make them eligible for Medicaid coverage in Texas. This means they will be able to access Medicaid coverage and marketplace tax credits for the remainder of the calendar year. Other people who lose coverage could switch to insurance offered through a spouse’s or parents’ employer and others may qualify for coverage but opt not to enroll, according to the report. So even though an estimated 1 in 4 Texans will now be without health insurance coverage, the actual number of people who are uninsured and ""don’t have access to healthcare insurance"" is likely even lower. A July report from Families USA, a research and advocacy non-profit that supports policies that make healthcare more accessible, offers a closer estimate. The report tried to pin down the number of uninsured adults who would be unable to obtain new health insurance coverage after losing employment during the coronavirus pandemic. The report estimates that about 5.4 million people across the country became uninsured after losing their jobs between February and May of this year and could not find new coverage. In Texas, an estimated 659,000 adult workers lost insurance coverage after losing jobs and could not find coverage elsewhere, bringing the rate of uninsured adults in the state at the end of May to 29%, or about 1 in 3 adults, the report found. But these figures are just about workers, and don’t account for children and other dependents who may have been covered by another adult’s health insurance plan through an employer, which means the total number of people who are uninsured is likely higher than this estimate. Our ruling Hegar said 1 in 5 Texans did not have health insurance coverage before the pandemic, and now ""nearly 1 in 3 Texans under the age of 65 don’t have access to health care insurance."" Hegar is right about how many Texans under 65 were previously uninsured. The number of Texans without access to health insurance during the pandemic is harder to pin down, but her ""nearly 1 in 3"" remark reflects the latest available estimates.

211,"[Claim]:""Under-performing schools are schools where the matric pass rate is less than 60%. Under the ANC this went from 36 schools in 2006 to 85 in 2009. In just four years the DA brought the number of underperforming schools down to 23.""[Evidences]:Helen Zille, the leader of South Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance, says her party has the ""best story to tell"" ahead of the 2014 general elections. Beginning of March 2014, the DA launched a campaign that drew heavily on its performance in the Western Cape, the only one of South Africa's nine provinces that is not held by the governing African National Congress. The DA maintains that the ""Western Cape Story"" highlights the ""great strides made in the province since 2009"" and ""really is a good story to tell"" , one that could become ""South Africa's story"" if the party comes to power. In a video released on 7 March 2014, the DA set out many of the claims that are key to the ""Western Cape Story"". Africa Check investigated them. This report forms part of a series of fact-checks of leading political parties and politicians to be published by Africa Check in the run-up to the elections on 7 May. Claim ""In the ANC's last year in government, not one department received a clean audit. In the DA's first year, seven departments received clean audits."" Verdict correct In 2008/09 - the last year the ANC governed the Western Cape - the Auditor-General reported that not a single provincial government department had received a clean audit. In 2009/10 - the first year the Western Cape was run by the DA - the Auditor-General reported that seven departments had received clean audits. Claim ""The country's top three government departments since 2011 have all been in the Western Cape."" Verdict correct Western Cape provincial government departments have occupied the top spots in the Annual Public Sector Reporting Awards since 2011. Both the 2011 and 2012 awards placed Western Cape departments in the top three positions. The Western Cape Department of Agriculture has scooped the top spot for two years running. Claim ""Under the ANC, not one department featured in the top three."" Verdict incorrect Under the ANC, the Western Cape agriculture department and the treasury were placed second and third respectively in the 2007 Annual Public Sector Reporting Awards. The Western Cape Department of Local Government was placed second in the 2006 awards. Claim ""The Western Cape was ranked as the best run province in South Africa in 2013."" Verdict correct The DA referred Africa Check to an assessment produced by the Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation in the Presidency which evaluated ""the quality of management practices across a comprehensive range of management areas, from supply chain management to strategic planning"". The assessment found that the Western Cape government scored highest out of all the provinces for strategic management, governance and accountability, human resources management and financial management. Claim ""The [Western Cape] was also the only province with no irregular or unauthorised spending."" Verdict unproven The claim that the Western Cape was the only province in South Africa with ""no irregular or unauthorised spending"" in 2013 cannot be assessed as the Auditor-General's 2013/14 audit has yet to be finalised. Africa Check asked the DA what evidence it had to support the claim. To date the party has not responded. We will update this report if they do. Claim ""The Western Cape now has the highest access to water, flush toilets and electricity in the country."" Verdict correct The 2011 national census found that 99.1% of households in the Western Cape had access to piped water. Just behind the Western Cape was Gauteng province, where 98.2% of households were found to have had access to piped water. The Western Cape had the highest percentage of households with access to flush or chemical toilets at 92% . It was followed by Gauteng, where 86.5% of households had access to flush or chemical toilets. According to the census, 93.4% of Western Cape households used electricity for lighting, compared to 91.1% in the Free State and 87.4% in Gauteng. However, the claim does not acknowledge the already high level of delivery that the DA inherited when it wrested control of the province from the ANC in 2009. Claim ""The [Western Cape] also has the highest proportion of households receiving free basic water, free basic electricity and free basic sewerage and sanitation."" Verdict correct The claim is correct, according to Statistics South Africa (Stats SA). In 2012 , 66.4% of Western Cape ""consumer units"" received free basic water. Nationally, only 37.1% of ""consumer units"" received free basic water. The Western Cape provided free basic electricity to 43.6% of ""consumer units"" in 2012. This was the highest in the country. Nationally, only 24.9% of ""consumer units"" received free basic electricity. While only 25.7% of ""consumer units"" in South Africa received free basic sewerage and sanitation, 67.7% of ""consumer units"" in the Western Cape received this free basic service, according to Stats SA. Claim ""In 2009, the ANC left the province with over 6,000 health department vacancies. The vacancy rate for nurses was 34%. By 2013, the DA had brought this down to just 1%."" Verdict unproven This claim could not be independently verified. According to the Western Cape Department of Health's 2008/09 annual report ,  27,198 of 36,380 posts were filled, with 9,193 vacancies. Funding had not been provided for 8,549 of the vacancies and the annual report stated that their inclusion incorrectly ""inflated the vacancy rate"". The 2012/13 annual report stated that out of 31,733 posts, 30,345 were occupied and 1,388 were vacant. However, only vacancies for posts that had been funded were listed. The Western Cape Department of Health told Africa Check that there were no unfunded vacancies that year. If you compare the number of funded vacancies between the two years it appears that they have increased from 644 in 2009 to 1,388 in 2013. Cameron Arendse, Zille's spokesman in her capacity as party leader, told Africa Check that the claim that nursing vacancies stood at 34% in 2009 was sourced from the South African Institute of Race Relations' 2012 South Africa Survey . However, the survey attributes this vacancy rate to 2010, not 2009. The figure also exclude nursing assistants and student nurses. The Western Cape Department of Health's 2013/14 annual report – which could potentially verify the accuracy of the claim that the vacancy rate has dropped to 1% - has yet to be released. The DA referred us to two other supporting documents. Both are speeches, not primary sources. The first was a February 2014 address by the Western Cape provincial minister of finance, economic development and tourism, Alan Winde, in which he claimed that the vacancy rate of permanent nurses had been brought down to less than 1%. The second was an October 2013 speech made by the Western Cape's minister of health, Theuns Botha. It stated that the vacancy rate had decreased to 5%. Neither claim could be independently verified. According to the department's latest annual report , vacancy rates stood at 3.68% for professional nurses, 2.95% for enrolled nurses and 2.47% for enrolling nursing auxiliaries. The DA's reasoning for citing speeches by its political leaders as primary sources was explained as follows by David Christianson, the party's senior research consultant: ""When DA [provincial ministers],  or the premier of the Western Cape, make factual claims, we (the party) believe them, in the absence of evidence to the contrary… As a result, in a party political state such as this, factual statements by DA MECs are given as sources."" Claim ""The DA has increased ARV treatment in the Western Cape from 14,000 to 132,000."" Verdict incorrect Questioned about the sourcing of the claim, the DA referred us to an article published by the South African Government News Agency in February last year which stated that the Western Cape had ""increased anti-retroviral treatment provision from 14,370 to 132,279"". The article did not provide a source for the data. But the Western Cape health department's annual reports contradict the claim. In 2008/09 , the last year the ANC held power in the Western Cape, anti-retroviral treatment was provided to 54,703 patients. In 2009/10 , the first year the DA was in office in the Western Cape, anti-retroviral treatment was provided to 75,002 patients. The 2012/13 annual report supports the DA's claim that treatment has increased to 132,000 patients. The annual report states that 134,212 patients were on anti-retroviral therapy in that year. Claim ""[The DA] has brought down the rate of mother to child HIV transmission to just 1.8%, the lowest in the country."" Verdict correct The claim that the Western Cape has the lowest rate of mother-to-child HIV transmission in the country is correct, according to a 2011 study by the Medical Research Council. It found that the Western Cape had the lowest rate of mother-to-child transmission at 1.98%. The Northern Cape had the highest, at 6.06%, and the national average was 2.67%. Claim ""In its first term in office, the DA built three brand new hospitals in Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain and George and currently has 75 health care projects valued at R4.5 billion underway."" Verdict exaggerated The claim is slightly exaggerated. The Khayelitsha Hospital opened in April 2012 and the Mitchells Plain Hospital opened in November 2013. However, a new hospital wasn't built in George. A new emergency unit was added to an existing hospital in July 2012. The Western Cape's 2014-2017 Medium Term Budget Policy Statement states that over the next three years approximately R3 billion will be invested in health infrastructure. Claim ""While the broad unemployment rate in South Africa is a staggering 34%, the Western Cape has a broad unemployment rate of 22%."" Verdict correct The last Quarterly Labour Force Survey of 2014 indicates that South Africa's broad unemployment rate stood at 34% in the fourth quarter, compared to 22.1% in the Western Cape. Broad unemployment stood at 43.3% in the Eastern Cape and 42.2% in the Free State. Claim ""Since the end of 2012, South Africa's unemployed population has grown by 121,000. In the Western Cape the unemployed population has shrunk by 48,000."" Verdict correct Stats SA's latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey shows that the number of people in South Africa who are unemployed increased by 121,000 between the end of 2012 and the end of 2013. Unemployment figures in the Western Cape fell from 641,000 at the end of 2012 to 593,000 at the end of 2013. Note: South Africa's official employment data has not been without controversy and economists and the country's Reserve Bank have reportedly expressed scepticism about Stats SA's numbers . Claim ""Under-performing schools are schools where the matric pass rate is less than 60%. Under the ANC this went from 36 schools in 2006 to 85 in 2009. In just four years the DA brought the number of underperforming schools down to 23."" Verdict mostly-correct According to data compiled by the national Department of Basic Education, there were 34 under-performing schools in 2006, 84 in 2009 and 23 in 2013. Claim ""Since 2009 there has been a 25% increase in the number of candidates from poorer schools to pass the National Senior Certificate exams. In Khayelitsha alone, the number of passes has gone up by almost 1,000 since 2009."" Verdict mostly-correct The Western Cape Department of Education told Africa Check that the claim refers to quintiles one, two and three schools. The quintile system gives a ranking to schools according to poverty levels. ""Quintile one"" schools are considered the most poor while ""quintile five"" schools are the least poor. In a January 2013 press release, Western Cape education minister Donald Grant said the number of passes in quintile one to three schools had increased from 7,798 in 2009 to 9,797 in 2012 - a 25% increase. Data compiled by the national Department of Basic Education shows that 9,131 pupils passed in 2012, not 9,797 as claimed by the DA. However, Dr Rufus Poliah, chief director of national examinations and assessments in the Department of Basic Education, told Africa Check that the figures reported by the Western Cape Department of Education would be more accurate than the national department's data. ""It is their schools and they work more closely with them,"" he said. The number of pupils in quintile one to three schools in the Western Cape that passed the National Senior Certificate exams in 2009 could not be verified. The national department does not have updated quintile information prior to 2012. But other data from the basic education department does show that in 2009, 1,343 pupils passed matric in Khayelitsha schools. In 2013, this increased by 833 to 2,176 passes. Claim ""Under the DA, the matric science pass rate went from 53% to 73%. The maths pass rate went from 65% to 73%."" Verdict correct Department of Basic Education data confirms that the DA's claim is correct. The physical science pass rate improved from 53% in 2009 to 72.6% in 2013 and the mathematics pass rate increased from 65% to 73.3%.

212,"[Claim]:It is estimated that Arizona ""has lost more than $100 million in hospitality industry revenues since passage of the Arizona immigration laws.""[Evidences]:Critics accused Georgia’s new Arizona-style illegal immigration enforcement law of violating civil and human rights. ""Inhumane,"" they called it, and ""the civil rights issue of the 21st century.""The Anti-Defamation League also accused the law of crimes against the economy. The law, they said, is ""anti-business."" Major cities and organizations voted to boycott or avoid travel to Arizona after that state passed its tough law last year.""Convention and tourism business will likely dip, as it did in Arizona, where it is estimated the state has lost more than $100 million in hospitality industry revenues since passage of the Arizona immigration laws,"" the ADL said in a news release April 15.The claim that estimates show Arizona lost $100 million in hospitality industry revenue intrigued us. Is the ADL right?Atlanta business leaders fear it is. Last month, the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau's executive committee unanimously passed a resolution opposing Georgia’s law, called House Bill 87.Arizona’s law requires police to ask a person about his immigration status if they have ""reasonable suspicion"" he or she is in the country illegally. One provision of Georgia’s law gives officers more authority to check a suspect’s immigration status.Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a separate 2007 Arizona law requiring certain employers to use the federal database E-Verify to check whether their new employees are eligible to work in this country legally.We asked Bill Nigut, the ADL’s Southeast regional director, for evidence backing his group’s claim about economic losses. He referred us to news accounts from Foxnews.com, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times and The Phoenix Business Journal.Two May 2010 articles from The Wall Street Journal said the city of Phoenix estimated Arizona’s immigration crackdown could cost it $90 million in convention and hotel business.The Foxnews.com article cited a report from the Center for American Progress, a progressive group that thinks Arizona’s immigration approach is bad for the economy, that put the loss at $141 million. The rest did not give specific estimates but quoted experts who said the controversy hurt Arizona’s tourism business.We took a closer look at the Phoenix and Center for American Progress estimates.Both have limitations. Hotels and convention centers are not required to report lost business to the city or the Arizona Hotel and Lodging Association, which did some of the research on which estimates are based. Not all major convention sites are part of the association, and the group did not poll its members for more data.Plus, it’s hard to measure how many conventions would have booked in Arizona if there were no boycott.The city of Phoenix released its $90 million economic loss projection in May 2010. The figure was based on a list of about 20 events whose organizers either canceled or expressed concerns over the state’s illegal immigration crackdown, according to The Arizona Republic.The figure represents how much conventioneers would have spent in the region over five years. Actual boycott losses are unclear.So far, four groups have canceled their events at the city-run Phoenix Convention Center at an estimated loss of $26 million in business, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. They would have brought 18,100 delegates, who on average spend $1,451 each on hotels, restaurants, entertainment, transportation and other expenses. Phoenix’s figure does not include losses from conventions canceled at venues that are not city-run or future declines from events that never booked. It also does not account for indirect losses (the money businesses would have spent on supplies to serve conventioneers) or induced losses (household spending by people who would have been employed).Now, we look at figures from the Center for American Progress. It contracted with Elliott D. Pollack & Co., an established economic research and analysis firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., to determine the boycott’s impact on the state’s convention industry.The November 2010 report found the state had already lost $141 million in direct spending on hotels and lodging, restaurants and other areas. With indirect and induced spending, Arizona lost $253 million in economic output.Jim Rounds, an economist with Elliott D. Pollack & Co., noted that while tourism did lose money because of the cancellations, a portion of the declines were likely due to cuts in state funding for tourism advertising. Also, because few businesses would comment on the record on their losses, his estimate captures only ""roughly half"" of the total impact on tourism from the Arizona controversy.We asked economists Bruce Seaman of Georgia State University and Tom Smith of Emory University’s Goizueta Business School to review the Center for American Progress study. They brought up shortcomings that were similar to ones Rounds acknowledged but otherwise said the analysis made sense.Let’s sum up:The ADL’s claim that ""it is estimated the state has lost more than $100 million in hospitality industry revenues"" has some significant shortcomings. No group the ADL cited placed the losses at $100 million. The Center for American Progress placed the direct losses more than 40 percent higher. Phoenix’s estimate was 10 percent lower, limited to city losses and expected to take place over five years.These, however, are all just estimates and projections. The ADL’s point was that the tourism industry has and will lose millions of dollars.The overall idea that Arizona will likely lose big money because of the new immigration law is correct.

No, that's not true: the story comes from a satire website, there is no evidence that such a payment took place and the people referenced in the story didn't testify against Trump. The story originated from an article published by Bustatroll on December 3, 2019 titled ""Adam Schiff Paid Witnesses Over $40 Million To Testify Against Trump"" (archived here) which opened: More corruption from the Democrats today as reports from Capitol Hill suggest that Shifty Adam Schiff has not only been leading an illegal coup against the President, but paying the witnesses with taxpayer dollars. According to our source inside the Congressman's office, the treachery goes far beyond mere bribery: ""We have almost gathered the proof necessary to go public to the mainstream media about what's really going on here. Schiff and the Dems have been paying witnesses huge amounts of money to testify against Trump. ""Gordon Sonderland, for example, is said to have received $11 million in tax breaks and corporate welfare last year, which we are sure we can tie to Schiff's office somehow. ""Anita Hill was approached on Friday by Jon Stewart, who is known to stick his nose into politics where it doesn't belong to help people he thinks are 'needy' when actually it's all just a scam, according to our one guy. Users on social media only saw this title, description and thumbnail: Adam Schiff Paid Witnesses Over $40 Million To Testify Against Trump Shifty has been up to no good. While there is no such person as ""Gordon Sonderland"" tied to the impeachment inquiry, Gordon Sondland, President Trump's ambassador to the European Union, did indeed testify before the House Intelligence Committee on Oct. 17 and publicly on Nov. 20. In his public testimony, Sondland alleged that there was a ""quid pro quo"" between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, in which Trump offered a White House meeting in exchange for an announcement of an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as alleged interference by Ukrainians in the 2016 election. No such announcment was ever made. There is no evidence that Sondland was paid for these appearences before Congress, nor that he was bribed or induced with tax breaks or incentives. Schiff has spoken out publicly against such tax breaks for millionaires. Sondland's net worth is estimated to be roughly $60 million. The only others referenced by name in the story are Anita Hill, who testified against Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, not Trump, in 1991, and Jon Stewart, the former host of The Daily Show, who has also not testified against the president. Additionally, there is no ""Committee to Undermine Nine Traitors,"" as is claimed in the story. The site is part of the ""America's Last Line of Defense"" network of satire websites run byself-professed liberal troll Christopher Blair from Maine along with a loose confederation of friends and allies.

216,"[Claim]:""Mayor Bloomberg helped lower the number of uninsured by 40 percent, covering 700,000 more New Yorkers""[Evidences]: Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire businessman and former three-term mayor of New York City, has sunk at least $200 million on television advertising in his bid to become the Democratic nominee for president. That’s a staggering sum relative to his Democratic rivals as he lays out his argument for why he can beat President Trump in November. A television ad that aired more than 42,000 times across the country during the first three weeks of January claims: ""Mayor Bloomberg helped lower the number of uninsured by 40 percent, covering 700,000 more New Yorkers."" Since Bloomberg emphasizes his record on health care as a reason why voters should choose him, we wondered if he is right. Bloomberg campaign spokesman Michael Frazier sent data to back up the claim, as well as documents showing what efforts the Bloomberg administration made to encourage people without health insurance to become insured. Bloomberg, who was mayor from 2002 to 2013, said he helped lower the number of people without health insurance by 40 percent, covering 700,000 more New Yorkers. His campaign cited a 2003 report from the United Hospital Fund, which used data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey in March 2002. The survey showed 1.8 million New York City residents under age 65 were uninsured in 2001.(Health policy researchers typically omit people age 65 and older from analyses of health insurance coverage, given federal programs such as Medicareavailable to this age group.) In 2013, the American Community Survey, also produced by the Census Bureau, reported an estimated 1.105 million New York City residents under 65 were without health insurance, a reduction of 695,000, or 38.6 percent, between 2001 and 2013. Health policy researchers we spoke with said that Bloomberg’s numbers are generally accurate, though they noted the Current Population Survey and American Community Survey are different data sources. The data sets contain ""slight differences,"" but ""it is common in the field to use the two together across large gaps in time,"" said Catherine Arnst, director of public information for the United Hospital Fund, which produced the first study cited by Bloomberg. Health policy researchers said the efforts to improve access to insurance extended beyond New York City. Sherry Glied, a health economist who was assistant secretary for planning and evaluation in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said New York State expanded Medicaid to low-income people in October 2001, and further expansions followed that decade. In 2000, the state created a new subsidized private insurance program called Healthy NY, Glied said. ""The Bloomberg administration definitely ‘helped’ people enroll in those plans - setting up a special office to do so,"" Glied said. Katherine Hempstead, who studies health data as a senior policy adviser with the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, said changes in state policy might have played a role in lowering the number of people without insurance during that time period. The downward trend ""may reflect the fact that the state of New York expanded Medicaid in 1999 with the passage of the Health Care Reform Act,"" Hempstead said. To support its claim, the campaign cited the ways the Bloomberg administration helped get people covered. Among them: Bloomberg signed legislation that required the city health department provide pamphlets outlining public health insurance options in daycare centers and required the centers to make them available to parents and guardians. Through a grant from the New York State Health Foundation, New York City also set up a website in 2009 to educate people without insuranceabout their options. This included information on how to make health insurance more affordableand a tool to help individuals determine whether combining private and public insurance would bring down their costs. The city introduced an online pre-screening tool for health insurance eligibility in 2007, and it introduced online renewals of public insurance coverage in 2010. The Affordable Care Act, President Obama’s health care initiative, passed in 2010 butdid not substantially take effect until 2014. So, it probably did not affect the number of people who gained insurance before then, Hempstead said. Bloomberg claimed that in New York City, he ""helped"" lower the number of uninsured by 40 percent, and that 700,000 people obtained health insurance during his administration. His numbers are generally correct, and he is correct to say that he ""helped."" He isn’t taking full credit, and that is wise. State programs gave greater access to health insurance, while his administration worked to raise awareness about that access. We rate Bloomberg’s statement True. ",True,True

218,"[Claim]:""What concerns me is there is only two sentences that have been written about minority business.""[Evidences]:The Atlanta Falcons may not have made it to the Super Bowl this year. But their future is potentially brighter than ever. Team owner Arthur Blank* is pushing for a new $1 billion retractable-roof stadium to be built in downtown Atlanta in time for the 2017 NFL season.The Georgia World Congress Center Authority -- which owns the Georgia Dome, where the Falcons currently play, and would own the new stadium -- agreed to a framework for a deal in a nonbinding term sheet. That term sheet will provide the foundation for more negotiations later on any binding agreement between the GWCCA and the Falcons.Left to be decided is who pays for the project. The latest funding plan has the Falcons contributing most of the money for construction, along with an upfront public contribution of $200 million paid through bonds issued by Atlanta’s economic development agency. The bonds would be backed with hotel-motel tax money.While those negotiations continue, state Sen. Vincent Fort , D-Atlanta, questioned another part of the project: minority business participation. ""What concerns me is there is only two sentences (in the term sheet) that have been written about minority business,"" Fort said in a Twitter post earlier this month.We wondered whether Fort’s comments about the 24-page document were correct and what this meant for the project.The term sheet for the stadium project is available on the Georgia World Congress Center website. On page five of the term sheet under a category titled ""Additional Considerations,"" the first of four bulleted items addresses minority businesses.""The Falcons and GWCCA will adopt a M/WBE participation program to be included in design and construction contract requirements pursuant to all applicable and/or customary governmental M/WBE requirements or guidelines.""The one-sentence item is three lines long, so Fort is mostly correct on the simple logistics of the statement. But he appears to have a larger concern.The federal government requires state and local governments to implement the federal disadvantaged business enterprise program if they receive federal money for transportation projects. The program is meant to level the playing field for businesses that are disadvantaged because of income or other factors when competing for federal dollars. Many state and local governments also establish their own programs for disadvantaged or minority and women-owned businesses in sectors outside transportation, and they set goals for contracts awarded to those businesses.PolitiFact Georgia submitted questions to the GWCCA about disadvantaged business participation in the stadium project. In a detailed response, the authority’s chief operating officer said that records on that information did not exist.But the details are almost sure to be outlined in the final contract before any work is done, said Lloyd Atkins, a consultant in the minority business development office of the University of Georgia’s Small Business Development Center.""These minority and disadvantaged business participation goals are usually established early on because if not framed in the legal parameters of a contract there is no incentive to reach the goals,"" Atkins said.With the proposed stadium’s probable public-private partnership, a lot of the push for minority participation will be ""political will,"" Atkins said, with adherence to any goals set possibly monitored by the city of Atlanta’s contract compliance office. (PolitiFact Georgia asked that office about any involvement in the project but received no response.)Since Fort’s tweet and subsequent comments to PolitiFact Georgia, some members of the Atlanta City Council this week have lobbied for about 30 percent of the stadium work to be completed by minority contractors. Falcons executives said there will be an ""equal opportunity employment commitment"" at every stage of the project.The GWCCA’s administrative policies and procedures for procurement of supplies, equipment, goods and contractuals services states: ""It is the Authority’s policy to affirmatively encourage and solicit participation with respect to purchases of goods and services by qualified business enterprises to include disadvantage business enterprise (W/MBE) Women and Minority Business Enterprise.""Although the Falcons stadium term sheet is one very early step in the process, Fort said the brevity of the statement did not bode well for the participation of minority businesses in the project. ""In a state with such a sorry history of using African-American vendors, I was not comfortable with ‘a wink-and-a-nod, trust me approach,’ "" Fort said.Fort pointed to last year’s audit of the Georgia Department of Transportation’s disadvantaged business enterprise program. That audit -- publicized during the campaign for a regional transportation sales tax -- found that the state agency had fallen below its targets for awarding contracts to minority and/or women-owned businesses that met the federal definition of disadvantaged. Between 2009 and June 2011, the Transportation Department awarded eligible firms owned by African-Americans just 2.4 percent of its contracts even though those firms make up 14.1 percent of all companies available to perform construction and engineering work. Women owned-businesses received 8.4 percent of the work, and Hispanic-owned firms received 1.1 percent.After the audit, the Georgia Department of Transportation increased its existing targets for awarding contracts to minority and women-owned disadvantaged firms. And Fort used the numbers as part of his campaign against the regional transportation sales tax.When the Georgia Dome was built in the early 1990s and opened in 1992, disadvantaged businesses accounted for 20.7 percent of the contracts, valued at $36.8 million. The total value of construction related contracts on the Dome was $177.8 million, according to information provided by the GWCCA. Removing two sole-source contracts from the available construction work increased the disadvantaged business participation to 23.6 percent.Under the federal definition, white, male-owned businesses can qualify as disadvantaged if they meet certain criteria including personal net worth of the business owner.Fort said the current term sheet that lays out nonbinding terms approved for the new stadium contains only two lines dealing with minority business participation. He uses this brief mention as a reason to be leery of the state’s promise to carry out minority participation promises.A simple look at the term sheet shows that Fort’s statement is correct. But the explanation doesn’t stop there. Already City Council members are pushing for specific minority business participation goals, and whatever goals are set are likely to be included in the final contract before any construction work has begun. Because the details are not yet complete, it is impossible to make inferences on what the goals would be.Fort’s statement is partially accurate but needs a lot additional information.We rate his statement Half True.*Arthur Blank is on the board of directors of Cox Enterprises, whose media holdings include The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.",Conflicting,Conflicting

220,"[Claim]:Since Republicans took over after the 2010 election, ""the graduation rate in Wisconsin has gone from 86 percent to 88 percent. The black graduation rate has gone from 60 percent to 65 percent. The Latino graduation rate has gone from 65 percent to 71 percent.""[Evidences]:Ever since Act 10 passed in 2011, Democrats have argued Republican policies ""gutted"" public education in Wisconsin. After all, the measure included a cut of $792 million in state aid for schools. Now, state Rep. Dale Kooyenga (R-Brookfield) says the party’s actions have improved educational outcomes in the state. Kooyenga went on conservative radio host Vicki McKenna’s Madison show on May 22, 2015, broadcast on WIBA. He had this to say about education and the debate over the 2015-’17 budget. ""If you look at what we've done -- Republicans in Wisconsin -- you know this whole education debate over the last four months, five months. It's all been about inputs, inputs, inputs. Money, money, money, money, money,"" Kooyenga said. ""We should focus on outputs. And here's where we're at in education in Wisconsin. ""Five years ago, when Republicans had taken over, the graduation rate in Wisconsin has gone from 86 percent to 88 percent. The black graduation rate has gone from 60 percent to 65 percent. The Latino graduation rate has gone from 65 percent to 71 percent."" Gov. Scott Walker made a similar claim in 2014 when he said: ""graduation and third-grade reading scores are up in the state since I took office."" When we checked that claim in April 2014, we rated it Mostly True. Both numbers had gone up some, though the trend pre-dated Walker. What’s more, the claim was pretty much a numbers one -- there was no direct claim by Walker that his policies made the difference. That’s where Kooyenga’s claim differs. Did the numbers Kooyenga cited all rise? And are GOP policies responsible? The numbers According to reports by the state Department of Public Instruction, graduation rates have continued to increase. Here is a look at what the numbers show: 2009-’10 2010-’11 2011-’12 2012-’13 Statewide 85.7% 87% 87.5% 88% Black 60.5% 63.8% 62.7% 64.8% Latino 69% 72% 74.3% 74.3% Kooyenga hit the mark on the statewide numbers and the number for black students, but was a little low on the increase for Latino students. He had noted a slightly lower increase in the graduation rate, from 65 percent to 71 percent. ""The main premise remains the same,"" said Rachel Geary, a legislative assistant for Kooyenga. ""The grad rate significantly increased closing the gap between minorities and the rest of the state."" But what about the assertion that Republican policies are to thank? GOP credit A look at longer-term graduation trends -- and whether the rise predates the arrival of Republican control in Madison in 2011 -- is tricky. Just as Republicans took over, state officials switched the way graduation rates are measured from an old methodology that compared how many students graduated from a freshman class. Individual students, who may transfer in and out of a school, are not tracked, which can muddy the numbers. The new methodology uses a more accurate model that tracks individual students. The calculation was standardized across the country starting in the 2009-’10 school year, so new numbers cannot be directly compared to ones from the earlier system. When we looked back at the trend in graduation rates, the data showed the statewide graduation rate in Wisconsin has been on the rise -- about half a percentage point each year. When we asked Kooyenga for evidence of Republican's influence upon the rise in graduation rates, he acknowledged ""many factors, including dozens outside of public policy, have an impact on these metrics."" Experts say factors that influence how kids do in school include socioeconomic status, school type and location, and parental involvement. ""However, Act 10 was the most significant change to education policy in this state and noticeable improvement in outcomes has been evident every year since enactment,"" Kooyenga said. ""Superintendents have told us that Act 10 has freed up time and resources negotiating contracts, and instead allowed them to innovate and redeploy assets to better achieve their educational objectives."" Act 10 reformed collective bargaining and lessened the power of unions for public employees. The bill also included a massive cut to state aid to schools. We rated a claim that the $792 million decrease in funding was the largest in state history True in February 2012. Walker and the GOP argue that districts have used the tools from Act 10 to offset the cuts, like eliminating or altering post-retirement benefits. The controversial budget bill went into effect in 2011, and it's tough to say when the effects of the bills really reached schools. When the bill passed, about two-thirds of schools had already negotiated teaching contracts for the upcoming year. Others have since taken advantage of the flexibility allowed by the law. What if you used 2012-’13 as a better baseline for a post-Act 10 comparison? Was there a significant difference in graduation rates? Not really. Between the 2011-’12 and 2012-’13 school years, statewide graduation rates went up half a percentage point. The percentage of black students who graduated went up by two percentage points. And the Latino rate went unchanged. The last cohort we have data for graduated at the end of the 2012-’13 school year. Likewise, there was a small increase between those years, following the trend. Our rating Kooyenga said graduation rates in the state increased thanks to actions by Republicans, including the passage of Act 10. The numbers did rise, but the trend existed before the GOP took over. What’s more, experts say many other factors are at work and the passage of Act 10 wasn’t followed by significant changes.

Facebook user Glenn Bayliss, for example, shared a message on the evening of 15 March 2019 asserting that “no media coverage” followed a terrorist attack by Muslim terrorists that had occurred “yesterday” at a church in the Philippines and left 30 Christians dead: This Facebook post, which was viewed more than 100,000 times within the first few days of its initial posting, stated: “YESTERDAY IN THE PHILIPPINES A CHURCH WAS BOMBED BY MUSLIM TERRORISTS KILLING 30 CHRISTIANS. NO MEDIA COVERAGE.” No bombing took place at a church in the Philippines “yesterday” relative to 14 March 2019. This Facebook post appeared to be referencing a terrorist attack on a church in the Philippineson 27 January 2019, left 20 people dead (not 30), and was reportedly carried out by ISIS. This Facebook message was likely shared with a purposefully erroneous temporal reference in an attempt to support the unfounded claim that “no media coverage” followed the incident. Of course, a number of major national U.S. news outlets, such as CNN, the New York Times, and the Associated Press provided coverage of this deadly attack. CNN reported that two bombs were detonated at the Jolo Catholic cathedral in the southern Philippines on 27 January 2019, leaving 20 people dead and dozens more injured. The ISIS pseudo-state took credit for the attack: Two bombs tore through a Roman Catholic cathedral in southern Philippines on Sunday, killing at least 20 people and leaving dozens wounded, authorities said. Two suspected improvised explosive devices detonated at intervals at the Jolo Catholic cathedral in the Mindanao region, according to the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao. At least 81 people have been wounded, authorities said, including 14 soldiers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and two Philippine National Police officers. The first device went off inside the cathedral, and the second one targeted nearby soldiers who rushed to help the victims of the first explosion, Armed Forces of the Philippines spokesman Brig. Gen. Edgard Arevalo said. ISIS claimed responsibility for the bombings via its Amaq News Agency. Shortly after the Amaq report, ISIS’ “East Asia Province” also issued a formal communique for the twin suicide bombings. ISIS did not provide evidence for its claim, nor can CNN independently verify it. This terrorist attack was also mentioned in a March 2019 follow-up report from the New York Times about the rise of ISIS in the Philippines. The Associated Press also mentioned this incident in an article about terrorist attacks at houses of worship in the days following the massacres at two mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand. It is worth noting that the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines released a statement in the aftermath of the January 2019 bombing that condemned extremism, not Muslims. In fact, the Catholic Bishops called for Muslims and Catholics to join together in advocacy against violent extremism: We condole with the families of the several soldiers and civilians who were killed by the explosions. We also express our sympathies with those who were wounded and extend our solidarity with the rest of the church-goers inside the Cathedral and the rest of the church community in the Apostolic Vicariate of Jolo. At the same time, we condemn this act of terrorism that has taken place only a few days after the plebiscite on the Bangsamoro Organic Law. As we begin a new phase in the peace process with the creation of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARRM), we ask our Christian brethren to join hands with all peace-loving Muslim and Indigenous People communities in the advocacy against violent extremism.

In my district, more than 18 percent of residents suffer from food insecurity and depend on WIC to make ends meet.""We wondered whether 18 percent of the residents in the 1st Congressional District were actually on the WIC program, a number that seemed high. It seemed even higher when we considered Cicilline's statement that 10 million Americans are covered by the WIC program -- about 3 percent of the U.S. population. That would mean the people in his district are six times more likely to have WIC coverage than the rest of the country.We were also surprised that the program might be so inexpensive. You can't buy a lot of groceries for $100 a year.So we asked Cicilline's office for the congressman's sources.It didn't take long to discover that the $100 figure was wrong.His staff sent us to the Congressional Progressive Caucus, where staffer Minh Ta said Cicilline had relied on a dollar amount that the caucus had miscalculated. Because the program cost $6.4 billion last year and covered 9.2 million people, the actual amount was nearly $700 per year per person.""Honest mistakes are made,"" said Ta.Then there's the number of people covered by the program. Rounded properly, the number should be 9 million, not nearly 10 million as Cicilline asserted on the House floor.And what about the statement that ""more than 18 percent of residents [in the 1st Congressional District] suffer from food insecurity and depend on WIC to make ends meet""?Last March, the Food Research Action Center (FRAC) in Washington, D.C., analyzed data from the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a 2010 survey in which more than 352,000 people -- including 1,396 in Cicilline's district -- were asked: ""Have there been times in the past 12 months where you did not have enough money to buy food that you or your family needed?""According to FRAC, 18.0 percent of the people in the United States and 18.4 percent in Cicilline's district responded ""yes,"" an indication that they suffered from ""food hardship."" That matches Cicilline’s ""food insecurity"" number.But is it really true, as Cicilline asserted, that these people depend on WIC to make ends meet?FRAC said it didn't know how many in the food hardship group were on WIC.So we turned to the Rhode Island Department of Health, which administers the program locally.Spokesman Annemarie Beardsworth said the department didn't have a breakdown of WIC recipients by congressional district because it lists its data by community and Providence is divided between two congressional districts.A total of 9,858 Providence residents receive WIC, some in Cicilline’s district, some in U.S. Rep. James Langevin’s district. Outside of Providence, 10,665 people are covered by WIC in the communities Cicilline represents.Even if we assumed that every WIC recipient in Providence lives in the 1st District, that would total 20,523 people, or 3.9 percent of the 524,000 residents in the 1st District, a far cry from the 18.4 percent cited by Cicilline. If Providence's WIC recipients were evenly divided between Cicilline’s and Langevin's districts, the percentage drops to 3.0 percent.So the percentage cited by Cicilline's was at least four and a half times too high.Katie Vinopal, a policy analyst for FRAC, explained why the number of people with ""food hardship"" is larger than the number of WIC recipients. The food hardship questions ""can be capturing elderly people,"" she said. ""We can be capturing people who can't get on the WIC program [because they're adult males, children over age 4 and women who are not pregnant or new mothers]. We're also capturing people who are income ineligible.""For someone to say that people suffering from food insecurity depend on WIC to make ends meet ""is not right,"" said Vinopal.While we were at it, we looked at Cicilline's assertion that the proposed GOP cuts would remove a critical safety net for ""nearly 1,000 women, infants and children in Rhode Island's First District.""To back that up, the congressman's office sent us a June 8, 2011, news release from the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It warned that 200,000 to 350,000 women and young children could lose their WIC benefits next year. In Rhode Island, it said, the estimate ranged from 600 to 1,000.But because the 1st District covers about half the state's residents, the numbers Cicilline quoted for his district should have been closer to 300 to 500.Not only that, the page of the news release that Cicilline's office didn't send us -- we found the original online -- makes it clear that the threat to WIC beneficiaries isn't just from the proposed Republican cuts. It's also from rising food costs. The low national estimate of 200,000 presumes a 2-percent rise in prices; the high estimate of 350,000 assumes a 5-percent increase.We asked Zoe Neuberger, coauthor of the center’s study, whether budget cuts or projected food price increases played the biggest role. She said that, based on the information at the time Cicilline made his comment, if the Republican cuts were approved and food prices did not increase, 150,000 low-income women and children will lose their food assistance.So the direct effect of the proposed Republican cuts in Cicilline's district extrapolated to about 225 women and children, not 1,000. Food price increases would account for another 75 to 275 cases.The day after we heard from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Cicilline spokewoman Jessica Kershaw wrote us to report that the congressman had misspoke when he said 1,000 would be affected. ""He meant to say that those 1,000 Rhode Islanders could be from across the state -- not just his district,"" she wrote.""What’s most important -- and what the Congressman sought to stress in his remarks -- is that there are too many people who are going hungry and cannot afford enough food for their household and he strongly opposes cuts to programs that benefit the people who need those programs the most,"" Kershaw said.That's the message behind Cicilline’s statement. We certainly understand that people going hungry because they can’t afford food is a serious problem.But the bottom line is that Cicilline, in making an impassioned argument for a program meant to address the issue got most of the checkable facts in the statement wrong.Eighteen percent of the people in his district do not depend on WIC to make ends meet -- it's no higher than 3.9 percent.The cost of the WIC program is not $100 per recipient per year -- it's closer to $700.The number of Americans covered by the program isn't nearly 10 million -- it's closer to 9 million -- a relatively small error, but wrong, nonetheless.And if the GOP cuts were to take effect, the number of people affected in his district wouldn't be close to 1,000 -- it would be more like 225.They say that two wrongs don't make a right.

The footage provides no evidence to support the claim. It shows pro-Trump rioters as the attack was underway; some of the rioters identified in the video are well-known Trump supporters.USA TODAY reached out to the social media users who shared the claim for comment.Keven Ruby, a senior research associate at the University of Chicago's Project on Security and Threats, told USA TODAY in an emailed statement that as of July, his team has gathered data on ""over 900 individuals charged by the FBI, DC Police, or US Capitol Police for their role in the insurrection.""But his team has found ""no evidence of Antifa-involvement"" in the Jan. 6 attack through their research.""We cannot identify the people in the video and have no idea who they are,"" Ruby said. ""However, we see no evidence of Antifa in the video or any reason to think the individuals in the video are affiliated with Antifa.""The FBI also said on Jan. 8, 2021, two days after the attack, that there was no indication ""that individuals associated with antifa disguised themselves as pro-Trump supporters in order to provoke the mob at the U.S. Capitol,"" according to CNBC.Fact check: Arrests were made inside Capitol building on Jan. 6, and afterThe claim that the mob was already inside the building and the attack was a setup is also false.Ryan Reilly, an NBC News justice reporter, shared an hour and 10-minute long video on YouTube that shows a mass of protesters as they marched down the street and then became more violent, ultimately storming and climbing into the Capitol building.According to Reilly, the video was obtained from federal prosecutors, and it contains footage that appears to be the same as that in the Facebook post, as PolitiFact reported.For example, a man in the video and in the Facebook post shouts, ""We just need a plan.

225,"[Claim]:Scott Walker ""had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating.""[Evidences]:A reader asked us the other day to check a meme attack on Gov. Scott Walker that keeps making the rounds. She saw it on Facebook. The image in the meme, which apparently began circulating in early 2012, puts a dunce cap on Walker's head. It makes a reference to what would be the failed effort, later that year, to recall the Wisconsin Republican from office. Perhaps because Walker is now running for president, the meme has surfaced again. It said: ""Walker had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating. Is it any wonder he’s attacking teachers now?"" There is no indication on the meme itself of who produced it. Walker has denied being forced out of school. When we asked about the meme, his campaign responded by referring us to a brief comment he made Aug. 8, 2015 at the conservative RedState Gathering in Atlanta. Asked about lacking a college degree, Walker said: ""It's simple. My senior year of college, I got a job offer from the American Red Cross. A lot of my friends who were a year or two older had degrees and no job. I had a job offer, no degree. I'm pretty smart. I took the job."" As we'll see, Walker was a senior when he left for the Red Cross. And although Walker has refused requests to release his college transcripts, there isn't evidence to back the claims in the attack. College days examined Here's what we know about the governor's college days from a widely noted piece we published in December 2013: In February 1988, as a sophomore at Marquette, a Catholic university in Milwaukee, Walker entered a campaign for student government president. The day before the election, the student-produced Marquette Tribune endorsed Walker's opponent, liberal John Quigley, but said Walker was qualified. A controversy ensued. Students told the Quigley campaign they’d seen Walker workers and/or College Republicans emptying editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings on campus. The newspaper responded with an election-day editorial headlined, ""Walker unfit."" It decried his ""mudslinging"" and said another factor in its reversal on Walker being qualified was the alleged theft of papers, which Walker’s camp denied. Quigley won handily. Administrators investigated. But we found no paper trail, and could not learn from interviews, what came of that investigation, if anything. For our December 2013 article and at Walker's request, Marquette issued a statement saying Walker ""was a student at Marquette from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew."" That meant that no conduct issues, academic or otherwise, blocked Walker from continuing in school at the time of his departure. The university also said Walker was in good standing each term while he was enrolled at Marquette as well as when he left, and that he ""was not expelled or suspended from the university at any time."" In February 1990, shortly before dropping out, Walker took a job in marketing and fundraising with the local chapter of the American Red Cross. It's also possible he was lured from school by politics. In fall 1990, while still living in the campus area, Walker ran against then-state Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat now in Congress, and lost. Two final notes: 1. In a separate item, also published in December 2013, we rated False a claim by the Wisconsin Democratic Party that Walker dropped out or was kicked out of college ""not long after"" he was ""kicked out of student elections"" at Marquette. After the original article was published, the Democratic Party removed the accusation from its website. 2. As for his grade point average, Walker’s gubernatorial campaign said in 2010 that he had a 2.59 (on a 4.0 scale), about three-tenths of one point higher than the meme claims. But we don't know for sure, because he has refused to release his transcripts. Indeed, when Walker said in February 2015 at the Conservative Political Action Conference that he had ""unsealed"" his college records, we rated his claim False. He had authorized Marquette to issue the statements we noted, but he has not released his transcripts. Our rating An Internet meme says Walker ""had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating."" Walker left school as a senior for a job with the Red Cross, but has not released his transcripts, which has left some to question the move. There is no evidence, however, to prove the grade point average, ""was asked to leave"" or the cheating parts of the claim. We rate it False.

226,"[Claim]:The Obama administration offered ""$900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza.""[Evidences]:The Republican National Committee recently put out a questionnaire called the ""2009 Obama Agenda Survey"" in which it asks Republicans to rate their agreement or disagreement with a number of so-called Obama administration positions. But it looks to us more like a push poll, a political technique in which the questions are written in a way that aims to convince the respondent of a particular political position. In other words, they are political statements masquerading as questions. We decided to fact-check two ""questions"" from the survey, and you'll see what we mean. One is an allegation that the Obama administration has ordered a new initiative that requires FBI agents to read Miranda Rights to high-value terrorist detainees captured on the battlefield. We deal with that one inanother Truth-O-Meter ruling. Here, we address the GOP question, ""Do you support the Obama administration’s decision to offer $900 million to Hamas, a recognized terrorist organization, to rebuild Gaza?"" As you can see, built into the ""question"" is a statement of fact, that the Obama administration offered $900 million to Hamas to rebuild Gaza. During a trip to Egypt in early March 2009, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced that the United States intends to provide $900 million for humanitarian, economic and security assistance for the Palestinian Authority and the Palestinian people. Here's how that money would be split: $200 million to the Palestinian Authority to address part of its 2009 budget shortfall; $400 million ""to help the Palestinian Authority solidify economic and institutional reforms in the West Bank""; and $300 million in humanitarian aid for Gaza following January's 22-day violent conflict between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas. The humanitarian aid to Gaza would be distributed primarily through U.N. agencies and nongovernmental organizations. The strategy, according to State Department officials, was to specifically make sure the money did not go to Hamas. In testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee on April 30, Clinton assured that disbursement of the money ""will be implemented with stringent requirements to prevent aid from being diverted into the wrong hands."" Translation: Hamas. Some have argued, however, that the aid, while not going directly to Hamas, would still benefit them. ""Whatever officials in Washington might intend, the Obama administration's new Gaza aid package is likely to turn out to be a financial boon for Hamas, which wields actual physical control over the places the aid is destined to go,"" wrote Ilan Berman, vice president for foreign policy at the American Foreign Policy Council, in an April commentary distributed by Tribune Media Services. Steven A. Cook, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations and an expert in U.S.-Middle East policy, said there are legitimate concerns about aid ending up in the hands of Hamas. The problem, he said, is that supposed nongovernmental groups that purport not to have ties with Hamas sometimes do. ""We have yet to devise a foolproof system to ensure that money doesn't bleed out,"" Cook said. Still, he said, it's a wild distortion to claim that the United States has offered Hamas $900 million. First of all, most of the $900 million is going to the West Bank, not Gaza. And while some of the humanitarian aid disbursed through U.N. and other nongovernmental agencies could ""bleed out"" to Hamas unintentionally, that's far different from giving money directly to Hamas. Not only that, but the claim that the money would be used to ""rebuild"" Gaza after January's 22-day violent conflict between Israel and the Islamic militant group Hamas is also misleading. The money to Gaza is for humanitarian aid — food, medicine, repairing damaged infrastructure, removing rubble, etc. It is specifically not for reconstruction, he said, as Israel was concerned that reconstruction money might be used to build tunnels, weapons factories or the like. ""I'd give this one a D-minus,"" Cook said of the GOP claim. We agree that it's possible that even with safeguards, some of the humanitarian money could wind up in the hands of Hamas. But when you read the GOP survey, you are left with the impression that the U.S. government intends to write a big, fat $900 million check that says ""Pay to the order of Hamas."" To the contrary, Washington is taking steps to try to specifically make sure none of that money winds up in the hands of Hamas. We also note that only $300 million of the $900 million is even going to Gaza, for humanitarian aid. And the money is specifically not to be used for reconstruction. It is limited to humanitarian aid — food, medicine, that kind of thing. So the GOP is wrong on that point too. We rule the RNC's Hamas claim to be False.",False,True

228,"[Claim]:A new technology known as “anti-solar panels” could one day produce energy at night from deep space in much the same way that solar panels operate during the day.[Evidences]:A new technology touted as having the ability to harvest energy from the night sky may some day bridge gaps left by solar energy. Comedian @TheLewisBlack once joked the problem with solar energy is the sun disappears at night. Answering the call, scientists have now come up with anti-solar panels that actually don't need the sun. #GreenEnergy #solarenergy @SolarEnergyNews https://t.co/bXSKaZS9pY — The Debrief (@Debriefmedia) February 26, 2021 That’s according to researchers at the University of California Davis who designed so-called “anti-solar panels” and described them in a 2020 concept in the peer-reviewed scientific journal ACS Photonics. The idea took steam again on the internet on Feb. 20, 2021, when British internet media company Unilad published an article describing the “anti-solar panels” that could “generate power at night.” Traditional solar panels are made up of small photovoltaic, or solar, cells. These electrical components generate electricity through the absorption of light. By taking this technology and flipping it, the researchers said the potential exists to generate about 50 watts of power per square meter — about a quarter of that generated by a conventional solar panel in the daytime. Ultimately, small photovoltaic cells in a solar panel deliver power because the radiation source, the sun, is very hot and the solar cell, in comparison, is cool. The solar panel thus attracts energy from the sun to convert it into electrical power. But photovoltaics can only generate electricity during daylight hours. So, how can solar technology be deployed to produce electrical power after the sun has set? It’s a new field known as radiative cooling, and the technology was described in a concept paper, so it’s important to note that it is theoretical in nature. But under this theory, an object that is hot compared to its surroundings will radiate heat as infrared light. The sun is hot, so heat from it radiates to a conventional solar cell on Earth, which is cooler in comparison. Thermoradiative photovoltaics uses this same concept to traditionally absorb heat from surrounding hot objects, like a generator’s cooling tower or an engine’s exhaust pipe, and convert it into energy. But the theory proposed by UC Davis researchers turns thermoradiative panels on Earth into these so-called hot objects and quite literally points them at a cold object, for example, the night sky. Space is cold, so a warm object pointed at the night sky will radiate heat toward it to convert heat into electricity through photons, or light cells. “A regular solar cell generates power by absorbing sunlight, which causes a voltage to appear across the device and for current to flow. In these new devices, light is instead emitted and the current and voltage go in the opposite direction, but you still generate power,” said lead researcher Jeremy Munday in a university news release at the time. “You have to use different materials, but the physics is the same.” Humans have been using similar technologies for thousands of years in design choices for their structures. For example, indigenous communities in the Southwest have created adobe homes that slowly warm up during the day and give off heat at night to regulate the interior heat. In more modern times, white paint is used to coat the roofs of buildings to reflect sunlight and reduce heat during the day. And though the actual device has not yet been developed, researchers concluded that generating carbon-neutral power at night will help in the global push for carbon neutrality, paving way for new technologies that can produce clean energy around the clock.",Conflicting,True
229,"[Claim]:""While 9,000 state employees were added to the state’s payroll, Oregon’s revenue forecasts dropped by more than $4 billion.""[Evidences]:PolitiFact Oregon enjoys receiving the newsletters of Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point. He’s written about China, federal timber reimbursements, and most usually, state spending. He is co-chairman with Rep. Peter Buckley, D-Ashland, of the House side of the Joint Ways and Means Committee.Richardson’s newsletters often include statements worthy of a fact check, such as this one about state workers receiving a catch-up raise in 1981. (Inflation was so high then it wasn’t really a catch-up.) A recent newsletter made us wonder, once again, about the size of state government:""The rising costs of state payroll expenses must be brought in line with the state’s revenue resources. According to Public Employment Retirement System (PERS) records, in 2006 Oregon had 38,000 employees and by 2011 the number of employees had increased to 47,000,"" he wrote. ""Oregon finds itself in a conundrum. While 9,000 state employees were added to the state’s payroll, Oregon’s revenue forecasts dropped by more than $4 billion.""Numbers. Drool. Are those employee figures correct? Did the revenue forecast really drop by $4 billion? And, most importantly, is it fair to juxtapose the two?Richardson said in a voicemail left at PolitiFact Oregon Central that Democrats built a government that we can no longer afford. ""They expand government because their philosophy is that government can help more people,"" he said. ""Mine is that that may be true, but you run out of money after a while.""In his newsletter, Richardson cited the Public Employees Retirement System, which produces a report every year that lists the number of employees for public employers in Oregon. Richardson correctly cites the numbers attributed to the State of Oregon.But we decided to go further, because we’ve always been puzzled by the number of workers in state government.We pulled figures from the retirement system, and also from the Department of Administrative Services, which handles the executive branch of state government, and the Oregon University System. We tried to get the best apples-to-apples comparison, asking the agencies to weed out temporary workers and to focus on people eligible for retirement.We came up with a very odd table. See the problem? If you add the executive branch and higher education numbers, the number of employees increased 9 percent, or nearly 4,000 people from fiscal year 2006 to 2011. If you look at the retirement system figures, it increased 23 percent, or by 8,800 people. Also, note that the 2005-06 retirement system number is much lower than that provided by the executive department and university system. Part of the reason for the discrepancy, says PERS spokesman David Crosley, is because university employees can opt for another retirement plan. Otherwise, he said the agency could not not explain the difference in growth.Let’s turn to the revenue shortfall. Richardson is correct that the revenue that the state estimated it would bring in dropped by $4 billion in that time, from $19.2 billion in March 2008 to $14.8 billion today.But we also want to point out that for all of 2007 and much of 2008, the forecast hovered around $19 billion. The forecast released in November 2008 was the first to show a drop, and then revenue tumbled from bad to worse.The executive branch went up, then down, in hiring from mid-2008 to mid-2011, with an overall growth of 0.3 percent. The real increase was in the number of university employees over the same period, 6 percent growth.Why? Well, when jobs are scarce, more students go to school. And when more students enroll, colleges and universities need more people to teach. That 6 percent growth in hiring corresponded with an enrollment growth from 86,500 to 96,960. (The Office of Economic Analysis has detailed posts on the topic.)And while some of these new hires may end up in Oregon’s retirement system, remember that they’re financed in large part by student tuition, which isn’t state tax money. Finally, we’re going to throw one last batch of numbers at you, this time from the Legislative Fiscal Office, which tracks all branches of state government as well as the universities. We give you this additional information not to make your head hurt, but to give you different ways of viewing growth in state government. The increase in ""full-time equivalent"" budgeted positions is 5 percent, which is not as high as the 23 percent growth recorded by PERS.We contacted Richardson one last time, and shared our findings. He said he doesn’t have insider information as to why some numbers are higher or lower. But it doesn’t matter to him. The larger point holds: Government is not doing enough to limit costs when revenue is down. State universities, he said, could use technology and other tools to deliver classes more efficiently rather than increase tuition.""They should not be doing more of the same,"" he said.We can’t fault Richardson for using one set of figures to highlight growth, even though other sets suggest the growth has not been as steep. For some taxpayers, that we have more than 48,000 employees in state government and state universities is probably horrifying enough.Richardson’s underlying point that employment grew during a recession is accurate. In fact, the number of state and university employees is higher than that reported by the retirement system, as of June 30, 2011.But we downgrade our ruling for two reasons.The university system, state executive branch, and legislative fiscal office do not report the same magnitude in employee growth that’s reported by the retirement system. The 2005-06 starting point is low when compared with the other sources. We’ve asked the retirement system to explain, and they cannot find an answer.Also, if some of the increase can be attributed to increased demand at state universities -- where students in large part pay for the new hires -- it seems unfair to blame it all on Democrats’ inability to save.

230,"[Claim]:Image shows Amulya, the young woman from Karnataka who raised ""Pakistan zindabad"" slogans at Asaduddin Owaisi’s anti-CAA rally in 2020 in Bengaluru, participating in the ongoing farmers’ protest.[Evidences]:Amulya Leona Noronha, a journalism student studying in Bengaluru, was arrested on February 20, 2020, when she had stood on a stage and raised “Pakistan zindabad” slogans during a speech. This was during a rally organised against the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019 (CAA) by All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) chief Asaduddin Owaisi in Bengaluru. The parliament of India passed the CAA on 11 December 2019 and amended the Citizenship Act, 1955. It provided a pathway to Indian citizenship for refugees from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis or Christians, and arrived in India before the end of December 2014. Now, a couple of images purportedly of Amulya are viral on social media with the claim that she was spotted at the ongoing farmers’ agitation in Delhi. While one image shows a young woman in a beanie cap standing along with a group of men, the second image shows a woman in a scuffle with Owaisi. The caption to one such image collage on Facebook reads, “The same girl in Farmers protest who raised Pakistan Zindabad in MIM meeting. What is this connection? Who are the forces behind this. All the same faces seen in every Anti National protest...” The text in Telugu on top of the image collage translates to, ""The girl who said Pakistan zindabad is now a leader, it’s our worst fate."" India Today Anti Fake News War Room (AFWA) has found that the claim along with the viral images is misleading. The second photo in the image collage is that of Amulya. However, the girl in the first image is not Amulya, but Valarmathi, a student activist from Tamil Nadu who had visited the protesting farmers in January 2021. The archived versions of similar posts can be seen here, here and here. AFWA probe Let us verify both the images separately. PHOTO 1 We did a reverse image search of the first image in the collage and found the same image along with a couple of other images on the Facebook page of Anti Imperialist Movement-AIM. According to the post description, the images show members of different political groups in Tamil Nadu participating in the farmers’ protest at the Tikiri border in Delhi. The photo also captured Professor Jagmohan Singh, nephew of Bhagat Singh. However, the post uploaded on January 25, 2021, had no mention of the rest of the members in the photographs. AFWA contacted Muthuselvam, the secretary of AIM, who confirmed to us that the girl seen in the first image along with the viral claim is a Tamil Nadu-based student activist Valarmathi and not Amulya. He further added that the image in question is from a visit made by the members of AIM and a few other organisations to the protesting farmers in Delhi. AFWA also contacted Valarmathi who confirmed to us that the girl in the viral image is her and Amulya was not a part of their team. “The girl in the first image along with the viral claim is me. I have shared the same image on my Facebook profile. I went to Delhi on January 25 representing the Public Welfare Student Awakening Movement (SUMS). We were five people representing multiple organisations from Tamil Nadu. We went to participate in the January 26 tractor rally and returned on January 27. I know Amulya only through social media. She was not a part of our team. Also, we don’t think she was at the protest site the time we visited Delhi,” Valarmathi, who is currently pursuing her Masters from Madras University told AFWA. Valarmathi has shared the same photo on her Facebook page on 26 January 2021. She also shared other images and videos from the January 26 tractor rally organised by farmers. We also found multiple news reports by The Hindu, The New Indian Express and The News Minute confirming Valarmathi is a student activist from Tamil Nadu. PHOTO 2 With the help of reverse image search, we were able to confirm that the second image along with the viral claim is from the anti-CAA rally organised by Owaisi in Bengaluru on February 20, 2020, and the girl seen in the image is Amulya. The same image was carried by the BCC on a report dated February 21. Following the February 20 incident, Amulya was charged with sedition for raising Pro-Pakistani slogan and spent almost four months in jail before getting bail from a Bengaluru magistrate court. While Amulaya’s pro-Pakistan slogan left the organisers of the event red-faced, her arrest had led to a debate on the use of sedition charges in the country. Before the police dragged her from the stage on February 20, Amulya was heard saying: “Hindustan Zindabad, Pakistan Zindabad, the difference is ” She was detained before she completed the sentence. Owaisi, who was present at the rally had also tried to stop Amulya from raising the slogan. A video of the incident shared by ANI can be seen below. #WATCH The full clip of the incident where a woman named Amulya at an anti-CAA-NRC rally in Bengaluru raised slogan of 'Pakistan zindabad' today. AIMIM Chief Asaddudin Owaisi present at rally stopped the woman from raising the slogan; He has condemned the incident. pic.twitter.com/wvzFIfbnAJ — ANI (@ANI) February 20, 2020 We also did not find any credible report confirming Amulya’s participation in the ongoing farmers’ protest. Here is also a picture comparison between Amulya and Valarmathi. Hence, it is clear that the image shared as Amulya attending the farmers' protest is that of a student activist from Tamil Nadu.

231,"[Claim]:In May 2023, the outline of a giant penis was created in a lawn in Bath, England, where residents' parties and gatherings were scheduled to be held to mark the coronation of King Charles.[Evidences]:About this rating While the giant penis appeared in the grass of a historic lawn in Bath, England, it was unclear who did it or whether it was related to the planned coronation parties for King Charles on May 6, 2023. In what some may describe as a major dick move ahead of the May 6, 2023, coronation of King Charles, someone created a large outline of a giant phallus at a park in Bath, England. According toreports, the erect penis outline was 30-feet-long and seemingly appeared overnight, noticed by local residents on May 4. This was indeed a real outline of a giant penis cut into the lawn of the historic Royal Crescent row of houses, considered to be an important example of Georgian-era architecture. However, officials apparently don't know who did it, or why, though a number of parties and picnics had been planned in the area to mark the coronation of King Charles. Aerial visuals of the penis appeared on SomersetLive, a local news outlet.The giant penis caused quite a stir, leaving residents ""shocked,"" according to SomersetLive. Other residents shared photographs of it from different angles, some describing it as ""very funny."" Historian and resident Kirsten Elliot Swift said in her tweets, ""@Bathlive thinks [the phallus is] mown but it looks more like carefully applied herbicide."" She shared photographs from the scene, largely taken from the tip of the phallus. Speaking to us via Twitter messages, Elliot Swift wrote, ""The odd thing was how symmetrical it was and how straight the lines were."" She also pointed out that the grass in the shape was ""browning,"" leading some to believe that weedkiller had been used to create the shape. Another Twitter user, ""PDouble0k,"" shared the following photographs from the site, tweeting, ""Royal Crescent at its finest."" ""PDouble0k""even posted a follow-up taken from the bottom of the phallic image: Speaking to us via direct message, she sent another photograph with her shadow included. (Twitter/PDouble0k) She confirmed to us that the shape was still present in the grass when she went there around midday on May 5. However, according to a Bath-area Facebook group Born & Bred or Live in the City of Bath, the Bath & North East Somerset Council (B&NES Council) sent teams to remove it. Facebook user Mark Foster wrote, ""[B&NES] had their top team working on it this morning. The joke doesn't really work at ground level, it's a prank for the drone generation."" Somerset Live reached out to the Crescent Lawn Company, which is responsible for maintaining the grass in a section above the lawn where the penis was visible. A spokesperson said, ""The Crescent Lawn Company owns and maintains only the semi-elliptical area above the ha-ha on behalf of the residents of the street; the area below (i.e. south of) the ha-ha is part of the Royal Victoria Park, which is owned and maintained by B&NES Council.""

232,"[Claim]:Supported in-state tuition in Arkansas for illegal immigrants ""if you'd sat in our schools from the time you're 5 or 6 years old and you had become an A-plus student,"" among other things.[Evidences]:During a Republican presidential debate Nov. 28, 2007, a questioner asked Mike Huckabee about his support for a 2005 measure in Arkansas that would have granted in-state tuition to the children of illegal immigrants. Though the bill never made it out of the legislature, critics still question his support of it. Huckabee described the law's requirements as stringent, applying only to students ""if you'd sat in our schools from the time you're 5 or 6 years old and you had become an A-plus student, you'd completed the core curriculum, you were an exceptional student, and you also had to be drug- and alcohol-free — and the other provision, you had to be applying for citizenship."" That's quite a number of restrictions. Did the bill outline all that? No. The bill, proposed by Rep. Joyce Elliott, D-Little Rock, said that students had to have spent three years in Arkansas high schools and graduated, and they had to sign an affidavit saying they intended to pursue citizenship. Then they would be eligible for in-state tuition and a popular state scholarship program, the Academic Challenge Scholarship, just like their fellow classmates. Huckabee conflates the proposed law with rules for the scholarship, which does have requirements for a core curriculum and drug-testing. Maybe Huckabee was confused on which programs he was talking about; he had mentioned the Academic Challenge Scholarship by name a few moments earlier. But even granting a mix-up, Huckabee is plain wrong about the A-plus average — the scholarship requires a 3.0 out of 4.0. And there's no requirement for attending state schools since age 5 or 6.

233,"[Claim]:""Sue Lowden gave Harry Reid's campaigns a thousand dollars in five different elections, helping his Senate dreams come true.""[Evidences]:Sen. Harry Reid may be the Democratic Senate majority leader, but that doesn't mean he's a shoo-in for re-election in 2012. In fact, several potential Republican candidates outperform Reid in recent polls, suggesting Nevada voters are none too pleased with Reid.Republicans are vying against each other to challenge Reid, and the primary appears to have several front-runners: Sue Lowden, a casino executive and former state party chairperson; Danny Tarkanian, a businessman and former college basketball star; and Sharron Angle, a former state representative with support from the Tea Party Express, a national group associated with the movement. The Republican primary is set for June 8. The ads we've reviewed from the primary contest have similar themes: Government is too big, Washington can't be trusted, and only a true conservative should get the Republican nomination. Tarkanian's ad ""Insiders' Game"" sounds these themes in fairly dramatic fashion, using ominous music and flashy graphics, and manages to attack Lowden and Reid simultaneously.""Washington power was always Harry Reid's dream. That's why he needed to be stopped. Sue Lowden? She helped Harry Reid rise to power."" Lowden is then shown in a video clip, saying, ""I supported Harry Reid early on."" ""Sue Lowden gave Harry Reid's campaigns a thousand dollars in five different elections, helping his Senate dreams come true. Today Harry Reid's got his power, and Sue Lowden's worth millions. It's always an insiders' game,"" the ad concludes.We couldn't get a response to our questions from the Lowden campaign, but we did call the Federal Election Commission to find out about Lowden's contributions.She did donate to Harry Reid -- back in the 1980s. She gave him $2,000 in 1984, $1,000 in 1986, and $2,000 in 1989. The ad counts that as ""five different elections,"" because in 1984 and 1989, Lowden made donations of $1,000 each for the primary and the general. Her husband, casino executive Paul Lowden, also contributed $8,000 between 1982 and 1995.She told the Nevada media that she and her husband supported Reid at one time, but not anymore. ""Early on in the '80s when he was independent, we did feel that he was representing Nevada,"" she said last year.The ad implies -- but doesn't say explicitly -- that Lowden benefited from her support of Reid. The Tarkanian campaign points to a letter of recommendation that Reid wrote to the Illinois Gaming Board in 1992, expressing support for the Lowdens' casino operations, describing Reid's interactions with them during his time as chairman of the Nevada Gaming Commission from 1977 to 1981. ""I have found them to be great assets to the state, and I have found them to be honest in all their dealings with me. I highly recommend Paul Lowden and his company,"" Reid wrote. (You can read the letter via the Las Vegas Sun website.)Jon Ralston, a reporter and commentator on Nevada politics, pointed out in his own analysis of the ad that the Lowdens were wealthy before contributing to Reid's campaign, and that Reid raised plenty of money from other people. Here, we're checking the statement from the Tarkanian campaign, that ""Sue Lowden gave Harry Reid's campaigns a thousand dollars in five different elections, helping his Senate dreams come true."" The campaign is counting primary and general election contributions as donations for separate elections. You could argue that this was actually support for three elections, not five. The ad also implies that this support helped Reid's ""rise to power,"" and obliquely hints that there was some sort of mutual benefit. There's not much in the record to support that. Still, because the statement we're checking here is about Lowden's campaign contributions, which are a matter of public record, we're rating this Mostly True.",True,True
234,"[Claim]:“Melania dug up the WH Rose Garden, removing roses from every First Lady since 1913.”[Evidences]:First lady Melania Trump is expected to deliver her Republican National Convention speech from the White House Rose Garden on Aug. 25, just days after the renovations she directed in the historic garden were revealed. Not everyone was thrilled with the results of the month-long project. ""Melania dug up the WH Rose Garden, removing roses from every First Lady since 1913,"" one Facebook post said. ""She is as clueless and classless as her husband."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to the White House about the post and did not receive a reply. But a landscape historian we consulted about its claim laughed and said, ""People say the most outrageous things."" Here’s what we know about the Rose Garden. First lady Ellen Wilson planted a rose garden in 1913, but its official name at the time is unclear, according to the White House Rose Garden Landscape Report published this year by the Committee for the Preservation of the White House. In the second half of the century, ""Rose Garden"" started to appear more frequently, but it was used interchangeably with ""West Garden."" The Rose Garden that Americans are familiar with today reflects the 1962 design of Rachel Lambert Mellon, who was approached by President John F. Kennedy to help renew the space after he was inspired by the gardens he saw at official residences on a state visit to Europe. ""The garden had a simple plan,"" Mellon wrote in a 1983 essay posted on the White House Historical Association’s website. Saucer magnolia trees were planted in the garden’s four corners. A 50-by-100-foot lawn that could accommodate 1,000 people for ceremonies and receptions would be the garden’s center. Flanking the lawn: smaller trees, roses and other flowers. ""The one flower that unites all occupants through the history of the White House is the rose,"" the essay says. ""Thus, for most of the 20th century, the Rose Garden has been a rose garden. Now, in 1961, President Kennedy wanted it restored in spirit but revised to become more than just a private garden."" The Trump administration’s overhaul was done in the spirit of the garden’s 1962 design, according to USA Today. The flowers in the garden are mostly pastels and include taller white roses in honor of the first papal visit to the White House in 1979. Boxwoods were added, crabapple trees were removed to be replanted elsewhere, and a limestone walking path now borders the central lawn. Speaking at the official reopening of the Rose Garden on Aug. 22, Melania Trump said improvements to the garden’s infrastructure and utilities would make it fully accessible to Americans with disabilities. She also said that changes to the garden resulted from ""a thoughtful and collaborative process carefully crafted with the help of scholars and experts in architecture, horticulture, design, and historic preservation."" Drawing from sources like newspaper articles and contemporaneous accounts, the Rose Garden Landscape Report lists 58 different roses that have been grown at the White House over the years, from the Cleveland administration to the Obama administration. The first documented, large scale plan of roses planted in the garden dates back to the Truman administration in 1952. There isn’t even a definitive rose planting plan for the Kennedy Rose Garden, according to the report, and ""records are scarce"" for plantings in the years after until the Carter administration. That was when the National Park Service started producing reports listing changes to the White House Grounds and Gardens, including the roses grown and their location in the garden. ""These reports, along with the scattered knowledge of roses grown previously at the White House, offer a glimpse into changing fashions and tastes in American gardens for roses,"" the Rose Garden Landscape Report says. As the Washington Post reported in July, Melania Trump’s plans for the Rose Garden included the removal and replacement of most of the existing plants and lawn. But Adrian Higgins, the Post’s gardening columnist, writes that ""the renovation is long overdue."" ""Among the problems to be addressed,"" he wrote, ""a poorly drained lawn that had to be replaced annually, constant disturbance of roots of trees and shrubs by the seasonal planting of annuals, the die-off of rose bushes to the point where only a dozen or so remained."" Roses are ""fussy,"" said Marta McDowell, a landscape historian who wrote ""All the Presidents’ Gardens,"" a 2016 book about White House gardens. ""They don’t last forever — plants are living things — and so sometimes they do need to be replaced."" When Kennedy and Mellon redesigned the garden in 1962, for example, the roses from previous first ladies were largely gone because they died off or had been replaced, McDowell told us. ""Most of these were long gone by the time the Trumps moved in,"" McDowell said. Our ruling The Facebook post claims Melania Trump removed the roses planted by her predecessors going back to 1913. That’s wrong. Over the years, roses have both died and been replaced as different administrations have left their mark on the White House Rose Garden. Only about a dozen rose bushes remained before this most recent renovation. We rate this Facebook post False.",False,True

236,"[Claim]:Hasbro announced in February 2021 that the Mr. Potato Head toy would henceforth be referred to simply as the gender-neutral ""Potato Head.""[Evidences]:Mr. Potato Head, the ubiquitous American toy that comprises a plastic potato featuring holes into which a variety of plastic parts representing body features and clothing can be attached (e.g., ears, eyes, nose, mouth, shoes, hat, pants) has been distributed by Hasbro since 1952. The following year, Hasbro introduced a Mrs. Potato Head version to the world. In February 2021, however, Hasbro’s Twitter account announced that the “iconic Mr. Potato Head [is getting] a 21st-century rebrand” and linked to a Fast Company article about the change that stated that the “Mr.” was being dropped from “Mr. Potato Head” so that the toy could “break away from traditional gender norms”: The iconic Mr. Potato Head is breaking away from gender norms The toy giant Hasbro is rebranding its iconic Mr. Potato Head toy by dropping the “Mr.” from the name. On the surface, it may seem like a subtle shift, but it is designed to break away from traditional gender norms, particularly when it comes to creating Potato Head families — how toddlers frequently play with the toy, according to Hasbro’s research. But starting this fall, when the new brand is unveiled, kids will have a blank slate to create same-sex families or single-parent families. It’s a prime example of the way heritage toy brands are evolving to stay relevant in the 21st century. This means the toys don’t impose a fixed notion of gender identity or expression, freeing kids to do whatever feels most natural to them: A girl potato might want to wear pants and a boy potato might wear earrings. Hasbro will also sell boxed sets that don’t present a normative family structure. This approach is clever because it allows kids to project their own ideas about gender, sexuality, and family onto the toy, without necessarily offending parents that have more conservative notions about family. As reports that “Mr. Potato Head is going gender neutral” began to spread, Hasbro then tweeted again later in the day to clarify that the Mr. (and Mrs.) Potato Head toys would indeed be rebranded as the “Potato Heads” line, but they would also still be identified as “Mr.” and “Mrs.” on the packaging: Hold that Tot – your main spud, MR. POTATO HEAD isn’t going anywhere! While it was announced today that the POTATO HEAD brand name & logo are dropping the ‘MR.’ I yam proud to confirm that MR. & MRS.

238,"[Claim]:""If you look at the three people on the (debate) stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored.""[Evidences]:Three senators running for the Republican presidential nomination have slim records in Congress, said former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. On NBC’s Meet the Press Nov. 1, Bush said that he, on the other hand, ""got to be governor of a state and accomplish big things."" ""This is about public service, about solving problems. If you look at the three people on the stage from the United States Senate, all three of them have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored. If you look at Hillary Clinton, in 10 years, three bills she sponsored that became law. This is the gridlock that I'm running to try to break up."" We wondered if Bush was right that the three sitting senators he debated against Oct. 28-- Rand Paul, R-Ky., Marco Rubio, R-Fla. and Ted Cruz, R-Texas -- have only had a combined two bills become law so far.(Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., is also a sitting senator running for the Republican nomination, but Bush did not include Graham in his count, as he appeared in an earlier debate for candidates with the lowest poll numbers.) (In March, we looked into Cruz’s track record, and we looked at Clinton’s in June.) We evaluated Cruz, Rubio and Paul’s legislative records using Congressional Quarterly’s BillTrack database and GovTrack’s advanced legislation search. We found that Bush’s statement is accurate in that the three senators have sponsored just two bills that eventually became law. But the claim leaves out some important context, such as outside factors working against the senators and the fact that this is an incomplete measure of a senator’s impact in Congress. Put another way, it’s unclear how much you should read into what Bush said. Serving since 2013, Cruz has been the primary sponsor on 57 bills, one of which has become law. Rubio and Paul both joined the Senate in 2011. Rubio has sponsored 106 bills, and President Barack Obama signed one of them into law. Paul has sponsored 141 bills but none has yet to become law. Cruz’s bill, enacted in 2014, denied admission to the United States any United Nations representative who poses a national security threat (a response to Iran’s chosen U.N. representative). The bill was uncontroversial and passed unanimously in both the Senate and the House. Obama signed Rubio’s bill in 2015. This law, which authorized the State Department to support women’s rights in developing countries, was also uncontroversial and passed both chambers unanimously. All three also have their names on laws as cosponsors: Cruz has three, Rubio has 18and Paul has four. The caveats to Bush’s claim So it’s true that Cruz, Rubio and Paul haven’t had many of their ideas signed into law. But there are several caveats to Bush’s claims. Seniority matters. Cruz has only been in Congress for 2.5 years; Paul and Rubio have been there for 4.5. In 2014, National Journal analyzed which senators have sponsored or cosponsored the most bills that eventually became law and found that the longer a senator had been in office, the more bills they passed. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has passed more than 740 bills and has been in the Senate since 1977. At the time of National Journal’s report, the median was 78 bills passed and belonged to Sen. David Vitter, R-La., who has been a senator since 2005. Who’s in control matters. Until this year, Republicans were the minority party in the Senate, putting Cruz, Rubio and Paul at a disadvantage. It’s expected that the majority leader will schedule bills for his own party more frequently than for the minority, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. Even within their own party, more junior members’ priorities are at the back of the line. ""First-term senators have a lot of headwinds, particularly when in the minority,"" Huder told PolitiFact when we wrote about Cruz’s record back in March. That said, the Senate’s design allows for individual members to make a difference, even if they’re not in the majority, said Sarah Binder, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in legislative politics. They make a difference in ways other than just passing laws. They can sponsor amendments to bills, for example, or their bills can get absorbed into broad omnibus legislation. Cruz successfully sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that will give Purple Hearts to those killed or wounded in the shooting at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009. They can also use their platform to shape the national conversation, such as Paul’s efforts to raise awareness of privacy issues and National Security Agency surveillance of citizens' phone and other records. Or, they can put a plug in the opposing party’s agenda, like when Cruz spearheaded efforts to block presidential appointments to push his priorities. ""That's not quite the same as shepherding a bill into law, but it's an example of the ways in which merely counting bills enacted gives short shrift to other ways in which senators can make a difference,"" Binder said. Effectiveness outside of sponsorship. Another problem with simply counting the number of bills passed is that it doesn’t account for individual bills’ political salience. Binder noted that Rubio played a major role in crafting the 2013 Gang of Eight immigration reform bill, and even though that bill did not become law, it was an important piece of legislation that continues to be relevant. And the Senate is only one-third of the lawmaking process (the other parts being the House and the president), so many factors that go into passing a law is out of the sponsor’s hands, Huder said. A Cruz spokesperson told us that his impact in Congress is demonstrated through more actions than just the number of laws passed.We also reached out to the campaigns forRubio and Paul, and we'll update this post if we hear back. Looking at Clinton, Sanders Because Bush mentioned her, we wanted to briefly touch on Clinton’s record, too. Serving as the Democratic senator from New York for eight years (not 10, as Bush said), 2001 through January 2009, Clinton sponsored 416 bills, and three became law. She also co-sponsored 74 bills that were eventually enacted into law. There’s one more senator running for president: Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. Of the 190 bills Sanders has sponsored since joining the Senate in 2007, two have become law. He has cosponsored 33 that were enacted. Our ruling Bush said that the three Republican senators running for president ""have a combined two bills that became law that they've sponsored."" Bush has his numbers right: Of all the bills Cruz, Rubio and Paul have sponsored combined, only two bills have been signed into law. But experts told us that this isn’t a great measurement of a legislator’s effectiveness, and there are other ways to show impact in Congress.

239,"[Claim]:82% rise in provision under SDRF (State Disaster Relief Fund) during 2015-20, as compared to 2012-15. It went up to 61,220 crore rupees from 33,580.93 crore rupees.[Evidences]:The BJP government has made four claims about standing with farmers in times of need ( referring to the SDRF) in an infographic published on the 48-months portal. This article is a fact check of the claims made in the infographic. The BJP government has made four claims about standing with farmers in times of need in an infographic published on the 48-months portal. This article is a fact check of the claims made in the infographic. All of these claims refer to the revised list of items & norms of assistance from State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) applicable from 2015 to 2020. This is following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission. The Finance Commission in its report notes that the norms for expenditure have undergone periodic revisions and that the last revision had taken place in November 2013 before the 14th Finance Commission’s period. Has the Crop damage criterion been reduced from 50% to 33%? The first claim is that ‘relief to farmers in distress given in case of 33% and above damage to the crop whereas earlier it was for 50%’. As per the website of the Disaster Management Division of the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF), constituted under Section 48 (1) (a) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, is the primary fund available with State Governments for responses to notified disasters. The Central Government contributes 75% of SDRF allocation for general category States/UTs and 90% for special category States/UTs. The annual Central contribution is released in two equal installments as per the recommendation of the Finance Commission. SDRF shall be used only for meeting the expenditure for providing immediate relief to the victims. Disasters like Cyclone, drought, earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami, hailstorm, landslide, avalanche, cloudburst, pest attack, frost and cold waves are covered under SDRF. An answer in Lok Sabha in March 2018 states that, ‘the existing guidelines for items and norms of assistance from SDRF and NDRF were issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs in April 2015 and are applicable for a period of five years with effect from 2015-16 to 2019-20. As per these guidelines, assistance from SDRF/NDRF, include assistance towards input subsidy for crop loss of 33% and above, which was earlier admissible for crop loss of 50% and above’. It also states that, ‘the assistance so admissible is provided to all categories of farmers and is in the form of relief only and not by way of compensation for the loss suffered’. It is true that the new norms provide for input subsidy in case the crop loss is 33% and above which was earlier 50% and above. Claim: Relief to farmers in distress given in case of 33% and above damage to the crop whereas earlier it was for 50% Fact: The guidelines released by the home ministry in 2015 include assistance towards input subsidy for loss of 33% and above, which was earlier 50% and above. Hence the claim is TRUE. However, it has to be noted that the assistance is provided as relief only and not as compensation. Is full Minimum Support Price being paid for food grains damaged due to excessive rainfall? The second claim is that ‘for food grains damaged due to excessive rainfall, full minimum support price to be paid’. As per a government’s press release, procurement quality norms are decided every year on the recommendations of a committee of experts which include Food Secretaries of States. If quality of wheat or rice is affected due to unseasonal rains or any other reason, relaxation in the norms is considered on the recommendations of states after testing samples of food grains. As per Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 relaxation in norms is allowed in the case of broken and shrinked grains and if grains have lost shine. According to the act grains having more than 14 percent moisture cannot stored and procured. The Centre extends such relaxation in norms on a case to case basis when there are natural disasters. Such relaxation in norms is not new and happened during the UPA as well. It has to be noted that relaxation is not automatic and is considered based on the situation at hand. Claim: For food grains damaged due to excessive rainfall, full minimum support price to be paid. Fact: The Centre extends relaxation in norms for procurement of food grains on a case to case basis when there are natural disasters. Such relaxation in norms is not new and happened during the UPA as well. It has to be noted that relaxation is not automatic and is considered based on the situation at hand. Hence, the claim is MISLEADING. Is assistance of Rs. 4 lakh being provided for families of deceased persons? The third claim is that ‘families of the deceased persons to be given an assistance of 4 lakh rupees, up from 2.5 lakh rupees’. It is true that the revised norms of assistance from the SDRF increase the assistance per deceased persons to Rs. 4 lakh from the existing Rs. 1.5 lakh per person. It has to be noted that is not for farmers alone, but for any deceased person during a notified natural disaster. Claim: Families of the deceased persons to be given an assistance of 4 lakh rupees, up from 2.5 lakh rupees. Fact: It is true that the revised norms of assistance from the SDRF increase the assistance per deceased persons to Rs. 4 lakh. Hence, the claim is TRUE. However, it has to be noted that is not for farmers alone, but for any deceased person during a notified natural disaster. Has provision under SDRF increased 82%? The fourth claim is that. ‘82% rise in provision under SDRF (State Disaster Relief Fund) during 2015-20, as compared to 2012-15. It went up to 61,220 crore rupees from 33,580.93 crore rupees’. The provisions for SDRF are purely based on the recommendations of the respective finance commission. On the recommendations of 14th Finance Commission, the current government increased the allocation to SDRF from Rs. 33,580.93 crores during the years 2010-11 to 2014-15 (period of the 13th finance commission) to Rs. 61,220 crores for the years 2015-16 to 2019-20. At the same time, the current government did not accept the recommendation of the 14th finance commission that all states (irrespective of their special category status) contribute 10% to the SDRF while the Centre fund the remaining 90%. Claim: 82% rise in provision under SDRF (State Disaster Relief Fund) during 2015-20, as compared to 2012-15. It went up to 61,220 crore rupees from 33,580.93 crore rupees.

240,"[Claim]:Photo of vehicles blocking road shows Dutch farmer demonstrations in 2019, not 2022[Evidences]:An aerial image showing hundreds of tractors and other vehicles blocking a road in the Netherlands traces back to farmers’ protests there in 2019, but some users online have used it when discussing protests in the last month. The image was shared online as Dutch farmers protested in June and July over government plans that may require them to use less fertilizer and reduce livestock, in efforts to curb nitrogen pollution (here) (here). Demonstrations were ongoing as of July 6, as reported by the Washington Post and Politico (here) (here). A tweet with the years-old photograph has garnered at least 23,200 retweets (here). Other examples of the miscaptioned image can be found on Facebook (here) (here) (here). This photograph, however, predates the recent demonstrations. A reverse image search on search engine TinEye revealed it was posted online as early as Oct. 16, 2019 (here). The photographer – Jasper Nijland, whose name is included with a white watermark viewable in the left bottom corner of the photograph – shared a post with the image on Oct. 16, 2019 (here). The post captioned it with the hashtag #Boerenprotest (which translates to ""farmers protest”) Nijland also published other images of the demonstration (bit.ly/3IlD7BP). Contacted by Reuters, Nijland confirmed the photograph is from October 2019 and said farmers are now gathering to protest similarly to three years ago. Reuters reported on Oct. 16, 2019 that thousands of farmers drove their tractors to The Hague that day (here) to protest what farmers called at the time an effort to blame them for nitrogen pollution after a court ruling found the Netherlands in violation of European emission rules.

241,"[Claim]:A photograph shows a boat that sank during a parade for U.S. President Donald Trump in September 2020.[Evidences]:A photograph supposedly showing a sunken boat with a Trump flag was circulated on social media in the wake of a boat paradeheld in support of U.S. President Donald Trump on Lake Travis in Austin, Texas, in September 2020: Multiple boats did actually sink during this parade. However, the above-displayed picture doesn’t show one of them. This photograph was taken by Dusty Klifman, an underwater photographer who runs the Blueyes Belowsocial media pages, and shows a boat that sank near Traverse City, Michigan. While Klifman’s photograph shows a real sunken boat, the original picture did not feature a Trump flag. The flag was digitally inserted into the image to capitalize on the hoopla surrounding the Trump boat parade. Here’s a comparison of the real photograph (right), and the doctored image (left): A few days later, he shared a video of the boat: Klifman shared the real picture on Facebook in June 2020 — months before the Trump boat parade — along with a message stating that this photograph was taken off the coast of Traverse City. According to a report from MLive, which appears to be about the same incident — judging from details provided by Klifman on Facebook — the above-displayed boat sank in Grand Traverse Bay on June 19, 2020. The U.S. Coast Guard, as well as a local good Samaritan, successfully rescued all 10 people aboard. Here’s an image from the Coast Guard and an excerpt from MLive about the real story behind this sunken ship photo: A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter crew, local authorities and a Good Samaritan all helped rescue 10 people from a fast-sinking boat on Grand Traverse Bay earlier today. The incident began about 2:30 p.m. when the Coast Guard’s Sector Sault Ste. Marie Command Center took a distress call via radio from a 30-foot boat that was reportedly taking on water in the bay near Traverse City. […] But as the people were being transferred off the sinking boat, the vessel began to go under the water rapidly. This forced everyone into the water. The Coast Guard’s rescue swimmer was able to help get everyone back to shore with the assistance of the Good Samaritan, authorities said. The vessel sank in 250 feet of water. While this viral image was not taken at the Trump boat parade in Texas (it actually shows a boat that sank in Michigan with a digitally manipulated Trump flag), five boats did sink at the Trump event. CBS Austin writes: TCSO says five boats sank during the event. At this time, three were towed out of the water and two remain submerged. Officials say all the distress calls were resolved without injury or loss of life. Most boats that were taking on water, or even fully submerged, were hooked up and towed before they sank to the bottom of the lake. According to a press release TCSO says, when the large number of boats began moving together, the wakes generated large waves in areas where participating boats were dense. Law enforcement says they have found no evidence of foul play associated with any of the incidents.",False,False

243,"[Claim]:""Only 10% of 23 million people in Lagos have access to pipe-borne water.""[Evidences]:Nigerians are set to vote for the governors of 28 of its 36 states on 11 March 2023. The election race in Lagos state, the economic hub of Africa's wealthiest and most populated country, is being keenly watched. In a debate in late January, three of the Lagos governorship candidates debated issues such as education, housing, transport, healthcare and water supply. The moderator also chimed in with claims of his own. We check 18 of the claims made during the debate. Some are correct and some mostly correct, but more are either incorrect or unproven. Lagos is Nigeria's economic hub , so the race to govern the state is closely watched. Nigerians are set to pick a president and members of the national assembly on 25 February 2023 . Two weeks later, on 11 March, they'll vote for state assemblies and the governors of 28 states, including Lagos. The country has 36 states, plus the federal capital territory of Abuja. On 29 January three of the frontrunners in the Lagos governorship race took part in a debate organised by the Platform Nigeria , a nonprofit that organises events and conversations around national development. The debate was moderated by Dr Victor Oladokun, a veteran broadcaster. The three were Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour of the Labour Party , Abdul-Azeez Adediran of the Peoples Democratic Party and Funso Doherty of the African Democratic Congress . Incumbent Babajide Sanwo-Olu of the governing All Progressives Congress (APC) opted out on the eve of the debate. The three candidates answered questions about their plans for education, healthcare, poverty, crime, transport, the youth and more. We fact-checked 18 claims the candidates, and the moderator, made during the debate. The candidates: a brief profile Funso Doherty , 55, has a bachelor's degree in accounting from the University of Lagos and an MBA from Harvard University in the US. He has experience working for financial consulting firms in Nigeria and the US and has been a chief executive officer of three pension funds and investment firms. Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour , 39, has a bachelor's degree in architecture from Nottingham University and a master's degree from the US-based Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also in architecture. He also has a master's in research and public policy from the University of Lagos. He runs his own architectural firm. Abdul-Azeez Adediran , 45, is an experienced broadcast journalist. He owns a media company and is a philanthropist through his Jandor Foundation. He has an honorary doctorate in leadership and governance from South America University in Lagos. Candidate: Gbadebo Rhodes-Vivour Labour Party Criticising transport infrastructure in Lagos, Rhodes-Vivour claimed that the state government had built only 16 kilometres of rail in 14 years. He was referring to the first phase of the Lagos rail mass transit blue line , which president Muhammadu Buhari launched a few days before the debate. The line is one of six in the Lagos transport master plan . When complete, it should be 27 kilometres long. But the first phase is 13 km long , not 16 km. Rhodes-Vivour also overstated the construction time. A Chinese company started work in July 2010 and completed the first phase in December 2022 . So construction took about 12 years and six months, not 14 years. – Allwell Okpi Rhodes-Vivour also blamed constant flooding in Lagos on the state government's mismanagement of wetlands. He claimed the state did not have a policy to protect wetlands. Wetlands are ecosystems where water is the main factor controlling the environment. They include lakes, rivers, swamps and coral groves. Nigeria is a signatory to a UN treaty on the conservation and use of wetlands. There is evidence that the state government has drafted a wetlands policy . But this has not been made law . In March 2022 Tunji Bello, the state's environment commissioner, said the policy was still being reviewed. It is therefore not in force. – Allwell Okpi The claim that 2 million children in Lagos don't attend school was frequently repeated during the debate. Oladokun , the moderator, and the candidates Rhodes-Vivour and Abdul-Azeez Adediran all said it. State officials have also made the claim. But is this true? Not according to the available data. The most recent estimate by Unesco , the UN's education and culture agency, is that 20 million children across Nigeria are out of school. The data comes from t he federal ministry of education , the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) and others. So if Lagos, one of 36 states, has 2 million out-of-school children, it would account for 10% of the national total. This was not possible, Oriyomi Ogunwale told Africa Check. He is the project lead at Eduplana , a Nigerian organisation that focuses on education. ""Lagos is not among the states with the highest number of out-of-school children in the country. Even northern states like Bauchi, Sokoto, Kano, or Kebbi with some of the highest rates do not have up to 2 million."" Politicians often trotted out unsupported numbers, Ogunwale said. But part of the problem was that Lagos state rarely published data. ""It is not easy to look up Lagos state data on education and other areas."" Lagos one of four states with lowest out-of-school rates In late 2022, the NBS published its first multidimensional poverty index . This found that 28.7% of children aged six to 15 were out of school, across Nigeria. This is about 16.2 million children, based on the estimate of 56.3 million children in that age range. The northern state of Kebbi had the highest rate of out-of school children, at 67.6% . It was followed by Sokoto (66.4%), Yobe (62.9%) and Zamfara at 61.3%. At 6.4% , Lagos had one of the lowest rates. Only three other states, also in the south, had lower: Anambra (2.9%), Imo (5.1%) and Abia (5.6%). The survey put the number of school-age children that are out of school in Lagos at 200,000 , or about 10% of the claimed figure. Also, data put out in 2018 by the Universal Basic Education Commission gave the figure for out-of-school children in Lagos as 254,654 . This is still the agency's most recent published data. – Allwell Okpi The Lagos public school system was failing, Rhodes-Vivour said during the debate . As evidence, he claimed only 14% of the state's pupils were in public primary schools. The 2019 federal education ministry's Nigeria digest of education statistics puts the number of primary school pupils in Lagos at 885,045 . Of these, 405,316 were in public schools and 479,729 in private schools. But the digest adds that the figure for private schools was from as far back as 2016, so it could now be significantly more. Working with the available figures, the share of pupils in public schools comes to 45.8%, three times higher than Rhodes-Vivour claimed. The Lagos state annual school census report for 2019 gives a slightly lower figure of 402,770 public primary schools in the state, but does not give a figure for private schools. – Allwell Okpi Rhodes-Vivour also said that only 25% of secondary school students were in public schools. The 2019 education digest breaks down the data for secondary schools into junior and senior secondary. Lagos had 543,242 students in junior secondary schools in 2019. Of these 372,883 , or 68.64%, were in public schools. In the same year there were 394,884 students in senior secondary. Of these, 242,255 or 61.35% attended public schools, while the rest were in private schools. The Lagos school census has lower numbers – 372,295 students in public junior secondary and 234,611 in public senior secondary. Despite the disparity between the Lagos census and national data, the evidence is that significantly more than 25% of the state's secondary school students attend public schools. – Allwell Okpi . Candidate: Abdul-Azeez Adediran Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) The most recent data from the 2019 Nigeria digest of education statistics puts the total number of teachers in Lagos state at 177,558. Of those, 60,216 were primary school teachers, 51,902 junior secondary school teachers and 65,440 secondary school teachers. To mark world teachers' day in October 2020, Buhari announced improved terms for teachers. Eight months later the president asked the national assembly to raise teachers' retirement age from 60 to 65 years. This was approved and became national law in April 2022. But does the law apply in Lagos? The new retirement age or years of service was yet to be implemented in the state, Akintoye Hassan, t he chairperson of the Nigerian Union of Teachers in Lagos, told Africa Check. ""We are yet to have the implementation of the 65 years in Lagos state,"" he said. ""The union is still making efforts to make the government pronounce the approval of it so urgently before the election."" – Catherine Adeniyi After the new terms for teachers became national law, the federal government asked states to implement them. Borno , Kebbi and Ondo are among the states reported to have done so. Adediran claimed Lagos was the only state in Nigeria that hadn't. Teachers' union chair Hassan told Africa Check that Lagos was not the only state yet to put the new terms in place. He added that an analysis was needed to find out how many other states hadn't yet done so. Africa Check was also unable to independently verify the claim at the time of publishing this report. Until we do, we will rate the claim as unproven. – Catherine Adeniyi Adediran made this claim while outlining how he would, if elected, make sure all children attended school. According to the 2019 Nigeria digest of education statistics , Lagos state has 13,633 private schools. Of these, 12,373 are in urban areas and 1,260 are rural. But in 2019 state education commissioner Folashade Adefisayo reportedly said there were 18,573 private schools in Lagos. Adefisayo is also on record as saying in May 2021 that only a quarter of the roughly 20,000 private schools in Lagos were registered with the state. We have asked the state why the numbers at national and state level differ so much, but are yet to receive a reply. Despite this, there are certainly more than 5,000 private schools in Lagos. – Catherine Adeniyi Candidate: Funso Doherty Action Democratic Congress (ADC) Doherty said if he were elected his administration would review Lagos's education curriculum so as to produce more skilled workers. He claimed that only 10,000, or 1%, of the state's 1 million public school students attended technical schools. These schools train students to become technicians: mechanics, electricians, welders, plumbers, caterers, and graphic designers. A student has to have completed junior secondary to be admitted to a public technical school in Lagos. The Lagos state schools census 2018/19 is the most recent data on the state's website. It shows there were 1,082,634 students in its public schools, of which 7,825 , or 0.72%, were in technical schools. – Allwell Okpi Nigeria's youthful population was an advantage for Lagos state in areas such as sports, Doherty said . He then claimed the median age in Nigeria was "" about 17 "". The median age is the midpoint of a population's age range. The number of people older than the median age is equal to the number of people who are younger. The UN department of economic and social affairs population division gives Nigeria's media age as 17.1 in 2022 , and expected to inch up to 17.2 in 2023. In 1990, the country's median age was 16.4 .– Allwell Okpi Claims by the moderator: Dr Victor Oladokun Moderator Victor Oladokun also made a few claims, most of them unproven. ( See how we define this and other verdicts .) One of his more checkable claims was about health staffing. ""According to the National Bureau of Statistics, there are 2,561 registered doctors in Lagos,"" he said . The bureau 's most recent data, published in August 2021, did estimate this number for 2019. Of these, 1,490 were male and 1,071 female. The Lagos doctor brain drain But the data leaves out the issue of brain drain. There were 7,343 registered doctors in Lagos state in 2017, and 8,276 in 2018. Dr Benjamin Olowojebutu, the chair of the Lagos chapter of the Nigerian Medical Association said in December 2022 that 507 of the state's doctors had migrated to the UK from March 2020 to October 2022. In December 2022 alone, Olowojebutu said , Lagos state lost more than 1,800 doctors and other healthcare workers to brain drain. These exits meant the NBS estimate should not be taken as being the same today, Leo Sanni, a statistical information officer at the bureau, told Africa Check. – Motunrayo Joel Africa Check has fact-checked several claims about a doctor-to-patient ratio supposedly recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). But the WHO has said it does not prescribe any ideal ratio ""because there isn't a simple answer or one-size-fits-all solution"" . ""All health systems are different: different organisations, different financial systems, different organisations of the workforce. What could work in one country would not in another,"" a WHO expert previously told us. The WHO only says countries with fewer than 10 doctors – and 40 nurses and midwives – for every 10,000 people do not have enough healthcare professionals. – Motunrayo Joel Oladokun claimed that there were 23 million people living in Lagos. If this were true, his claim would be correct. But the state's population is highly controversial . Nigeria's last census, in 2006, estimated there were 9 million Lagosians. In data published on its website in 2015 , which remains up, the state government gave the population as 24.6 million. Just a year later, the NBS estimated the state's population at 12.6 million . – Motunrayo Joel As noted in the previous two claims, and working with Oladokun's population estimate and the NBS's registered doctor estimate of 2,561, the ratio is 1:8,980 – nine times – what the WHO is claimed to have recommended. But with weak data on state and doctor population, and a nonexistent WHO recommendation, the claim is unproven. – Motunrayo Joel Oladokun claimed that only a 10th of Lagos's 23 million people have access to pipe-borne water. Pipe-borne water is potable water free of contamination, particularly by faeces. To check this claim, we consulted the 2021 water, sanitation and hygiene national outcome routine mapping survey, or Wash-Norm . This is an annual survey by the federal water ministry, done in partnership with the NBS and the UN's children agency, Unicef . The 2021 Wash-Norm survey is the third in the series, after the 2018 and 2019 editions. Published in June 2022, it covers 13,376,240 households in Lagos. It found that only 5.3% of the state's population has access to pipe-borne water. Another data source is the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey . After assessing 12,588 households from September 2021 to December 2021, the survey estimated that 5% of people in Lagos have access to pipe-borne water. – Motunrayo Joel We traced this claim to a December 2022 report in the Guardian , a Nigerian newspaper. It claims that the state has a population of about 25 million, and that 60% of its young people are aged 15 to 35. This works out at 10 million young people, not 13 million. The state's most recent demographic report is from 2015 . This gave the state's population as 23 million, nearly two thirds ( 64% ) of them aged 15 to 59. This translates to 14.7 million people. – Motunrayo Joel The Lagos State Residents' Registration Agency would have this data.  We have asked the agency for this information but are yet to hear back. We will update this report with their response. There have been several estimates in the media, including this blog which appears to be the source of the claim's 1.49 million figure . But without data we can independently verify, we rate the claim as unproven. – Motunrayo Joel The blog also claims Lagos state has a deficit of 3.2 million housing units. But in the absence of data we also rate this claim as unproven. A major issue with housing in Lagos was the lack of data on the number of housing units the state needed, Eziyi Ibem , the head of the University of Nigeria 's architecture department, told Africa Check. ""All the data being published in the news media and academic papers are based on estimations. As a result, it is difficult to know the exact housing supply deficit in Lagos,"" he said. ""The best approach to knowing the right housing stock is to carry out an accurate housing census in Lagos. I hope the upcoming national census can help in achieving this."" Ibem said developing housing standards for low-income people would help solve the state's housing crisis. ""Based on this housing standard, religious organisations, philanthropic organisations and housing cooperatives would be encouraged to invest heavily in social housing programmes for the poor and low-income earners in the city. ""This can succeed with support from the government in the provision of land and housing infrastructure."" – Motunrayo Joel",Conflicting,True

245,"[Claim]:In an interview that published widely in 1976, David Bowie said he believed in fascism and that ""Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars.""[Evidences]:In late 2020, Snopes uncovered evidence to prove the legitimacy of online claims that musician Eric Clapton went on an obscenely racist rant during a concert in Birmingham, England, in 1976. In response to that investigation, a reader alleged another legendary rocker, David Bowie, had also made inflammatory remarks at that time, comments in which he praised fascism and German dictator Adolf Hitler. We found other online forums debating the legitimacy and intent of alleged statements from Bowie’s past, some of which social media users created after his death in January 2016. For the purpose of this report, Snopes obtained newspaper and magazine archives, as well as considered the analysis of so-called Bowieologists who study Bowie’s artistic and personal evolution, to determine whether he had indeed stated support for fascism and called Hitler a rock star and, if so, those comments remained at the core of his social and political beliefs. Based on our research, Bowie was documented on several occasions in the early and mid-1970’s discussing fascism, including unhinged rants to journalists about the dictator known for orchestrating the Holocaust and how far-right ideologies could help Britain. It appears no audio recording of such remarks exist; however, he effectively confirmed the authenticity of them in subsequent interviews, and reportedly told a journalist in October 1977 that he was not a fascist but rather apolitical. Bowie’s fixation with fascist mythology and Nazi imagery began when he met British writer Christopher Isherwood after a concert in Los Angeles in 1974, per The Daily Beast. One of the first documented instances in which Bowie publicly expressed fascist leanings occurred during an interview the same year, according to David Buckley’s biography titled, “Strange Fascination: David Bowie: The Definitive Story,” though the press did not draw heavy attention to those inflammatory remarks until 1976, after subsequent controversies. Cameron Crowe, an American director and writer, conducted the infamous Bowie interview, which Playboy magazine published in September 1976. Snopes obtained its transcript courtesy of Crowe’s website and Playboy.com, reading: Playboy: You’ve often said that you believe very strongly in fascism. Yet you also claim you’ll one day run for Prime Minister of England. More media manipulation? Bowie: Christ, everything is a media manipulation. I’d love to enter politics. I will one day. I’d adore to be Prime Minister. And, yes, I believe very strongly in fascism. The only way we can speed up the sort of liberalism that’s hanging foul in the air at the moment is to speed up the progress of a right-wing, totally dictatorial tyranny and get it over as fast as possible. People have always responded with greater efficiency under a regimental leadership. A liberal wastes time saying, “Well, now, what ideas have you got?” Show them what to do, for God’s sake. If you don’t, nothing will get done. I can’t stand people just hanging about. Television is the most successful fascist, needless to say. Rock stars are fascists, too. Adolf Hitler was one of the first rock stars. Bowie continued by describing Hitler “as good as Jagger” in how he “worked an audience” and used the media to his advantage. After several more questions from Crowe on a variety of topics, the journalist asked Bowie if he stood by and believed everything he had said in their conversation. “Everything but the inflammatory remarks,” Bowie responded. In other words, it was accurate to claim Bowie said he supported fascism and that “Hitler was one of the first rock stars” during an interview that published widely in Playboy in 1976. However, Bowie at the end of the conversation suggested that he did not mean the “inflammatory remarks,” without going into detail on what exactly those were in his opinion nor confirming the perimeters of that request for clarification with the journalist, and Bowie did not explicitly disavow fascism or Hitler when the interviewer gave him an opportunity to do so. Around the same time, Crowe also interviewed Bowie for a piece titled, “Ground Control to Davy Jones,” for Rolling Stone. According to an online version of that piece, Bowie said he “could have been Hitler in England,” and that he’d be an “excellent dictator — very eccentric and quite mad.” In Buckley’s book, which drew from interviews with Bowie’s inner circle, newspaper archives, and academic research, Bowie alluded to far-right politics in a separate 1975 interview, saying: ‘I think that morals should be straightened up for a start. They’re disgusting.’ He added, ‘There will be a political figure in the not too distant future who’ll sweep through this part of the world like early rock’n’ roll did. You probably hope I’m not right but I am … You’ve got to have an extreme right front come up and sweep everything off its feet and tidy everything up. Then you can get a new form of liberalism.’ The following year, while addressing the press after a concert in Stockholm, Sweden, Bowie said, according to Buckley: “As I see it, I am the only alternative for the premier in England. I believe Britain could benefit from a fascist leader. After all, fascism is really nationalism.” Aside from those published quotes, perhaps the most physical of evidence of Bowie’s flirtation with Nazism surfaced in April 1976, when Bowie was traveling from Moscow by train with a group including American musician Iggy Pop. Customs officers detained Bowie on the Russian-Polish border and seized a cache of Nazi memorabilia in his procession, according to Buckley and news reports. The London-based Uncut magazine reported Bowie was carrying books about Nazi Germany leaders Joseph Goebbels and Albert Speer, and that he considered them “research” materials for a film he was planning about Hitler’s propaganda tactics. “It was a long trip with very little English reading material,” said photographer Andrew Kent, who spent months documenting Bowie, in an interview decades later. “David was just looking for something to do; it was not a political statement.” At another point during the 1976 world tour, which Bowie centered on his 10th album “Station to Station” and the Thin White Duke “emotionless Aryan Superhuman” persona, Kent supposedly photographed Bowie giving a Nazi salute at Hitler’s bunker, according to Buckley. But Kent allegedly swore never to release that image publicly, and no evidence existed to determine the rumor true or folklore. Of that alleged display of support for Nazi Germany, Kent told Uncut in a story that resurfaced on Jan. 6, 2017, roughly one year after Bowie’s death: I don’t want to talk about it. […] I never felt David was a Nazi sympathiser. I’m Jewish, so if anybody would be sensitive to that and have bad feelings … I just think it was what I’d call an adolescent attraction. Arguably the most high-profile incident supposedly depicting Bowie’s endorsement of Hitler and Nazi Germany, however, occurred on May 2, 1976 at London’s Victoria Station. According to news reports, photographic evidence and low-quality video footage, the rock star greeted a crowd of fans from an open-top Mercedes. Media publications, including New Musical Express (NME), attempted to convince readers, however, the photos that showed Bowie with his arm raised in a straight-armed manner depicted the rock star giving a Nazi salute. NME published an image of the event under a headline, “HEIL AND FAREWELL,” though did not elaborate on the allegation or provide any conclusive evidence to support it in accompanying text, according to Buckley. Based on our research, no visual indicators in the photos or film provided proof to determine Bowie’s intention behind the gesture. “Bowie was mentally disturbed enough to have given a Nazi salute that day at Victoria Station, but the evidence is by no means clear cut,” Buckley wrote. In the wake of criticism by leftists and sensationalist headlines about Bowie’s political leanings, Bowie reflected on his comments about Hitler and fascism for possibly the first time publicly in an October 1977 issue of the Melody Maker. According to an online archive of Bowie’s press mentions, the British magazine reported: His comments were interpreted by some as advocacy of extreme right wing politics; others saw in his remark a prophetic nature, a warning rather than a gesture of support to fascist policies. I can’t clarify those statements, Bowie says wearily when the subject arises. All I can say is that I have made my two or three glib, theatrical observations on English society and the only thing I can now counter with is to state that I am not a fascist. I’m apolitical. […] He is reminded of his fascist salute to the country when he arrived at Victoria Station and is asked to define its significance. He virtually explodes from his chair. That didn’t happened [sic]. That did not happen. I waved. I just waved. Believe me. On the life of my child, I waved. And the bastard caught me. In mid-wave, man. And, God, did that photo got some coverage… As [if] I’d be foolish enough to pull a stunt like that. I died when I saw the photo. And even the people who were with me said, “David! How could you?” The bastards. I didn’t … God, I just don’t believe in all that. In other words, Bowie refuted allegations that he had given a Nazi salute at Victoria Station, though he did not dispute the accuracy or authenticity of remarks attributed to him about Hitler and fascism. Rather, he stated he was not fascist — contrary to prior interviews, including the infamous Playboy Q&A — and that he was apolitical. Over the course of years after that, Bowie attempted to explain and acknowledge wrongdoing with his past statements about Nazi Germany and fascism, per news reports, suggesting his heavy cocaine usage at the time, mixed with a dark obsession with the occult, created the unhealthy fixation with fascist mythology. He told NME in 1980, according to Internet archives: That whole Station To Station tour was done under duress. I was out of my mind totally, completely crazed. Really. But the main thing I was functioning on was – as far as that whole thing about Hitler and rightism was concerned – it was mythology. […] This whole racist thing which came up, quite inevitably and rightly. But, and I know this sounds terribly naive, but none of that had actually occurred to me, inasmuch as I’d been working and still do work with Black musicians for the past six or seven years. And we’d all talk about it together — about the Arthurian period, about the magical side of the whole Nazi campaign, and about the mythology involved. […] Mixed up too of course were my own fucking characters. The Thin White Duke — throwing him, it was like kicking him. There was such an addictive thing about what was happening there, that actually being able to ride that particular storm, I was able to send a lot to those demons back to their — well, wherever it is they live. Altogether, none of it is something to be dealt with unless you’re in a particularly stable frame of mind. When he moved from Los Angeles to Berlin in the late 1976, after the height of the Thin White Duke, Bowie told NME he “had to face up” to his fixation with fascism because his German friends “were naturally extreme leftists.” “Suddenly, I was in a situation where I was meeting young people of my age whose fathers had actually been SS men,” he said. “I came crashing down to earth when I got back to Europe.” In an 1993 interview, he again suggested regret for the coke-addled era during which a fixation with fantastical theories came across as an endorsement for policies that led to the Holocaust. “My interest in [the Nazis] was the fact they supposedly came to England before the war to find the Holy Grail at Glastonbury,” Bowie told NME. “The idea that it was about putting Jews in concentration camps and the complete oppression of different races completely evaded my extraordinary fucked-up nature at that particular time.” Three years later, Bowie performed at Israel’s Park HaYarkon — an appearance that showed he did not harbor any lasting Nazi sentiments, according to a writer for The Israel Times. In 2001, Uncut highlighted Bowie’s band at the time of his flirtation with fascist symbols was comprised mostly of Black and Puerto Rican New Yorkers. “Only the boneheads of the [National Front], who praised Bowie’s ‘Aryan’ sound in their literature, and the equally dim FBI, who reportedly listed Bowie as an ‘apparent Nazi sympathiser,’ could miss the illogical irony of his public statements,” the magazine reported. After Bowie’s death from cancer on Jan. 10, 2016, days after his 69th birthday and the release of his 25th album, “Blackstar,” some tributes to the rock legend brought renewed attention to the dark chapter under the guise of the Thin White Duke. For example, a Politico reporter asked Simon Critchley, a philosophy professor at the New School for Social Research and Bowie biographer, whether the artist was indeed a fascist. Critchley responded: He wasn’t a Nazi. It was misunderstood. I think there is a nostalgic nationalism in Bowie—a sort of nostalgia for the utopian idea of Englishness, of Milton or Blake or Shelley. One of the things about Bowie that’s interesting politically is this connection to the idea of Englishness, and this kind of whimsical nationalism that doesn’t really make sense other than aesthetically. I think he confused fascism with nationalism. In sum, it was accurate to claim Bowie not only told an interviewer he believes in fascism and that Hitler “was one of the first rock stars” but he repeatedly flirted with symbols of far-right ideologies, outraging some fans. However, he since expressed regret for the statements and said they do not reflect his social and political ideologies.",True,True

247,"[Claim]:“Central Park actually used to be a town called Seneca Village” founded by African Americans in 1825.[Evidences]:A viral TikTok post says New York City’s Central Park once was a town called Seneca Village. The video, which was later removed from the platform, boasted over 3 million views. It’s preserved in this tweet. In the video, TikTok user Hannah Stater said in part, ""Central Park actually used to be a town called Seneca Village that was founded by freed African American slaves in 1825."" She added that the residents were evicted and that this history is not well known because it’s ""uncomfortable."" This description is largely accurate. From 1825 to 1857, Seneca Village consisted of the land between 82nd and 89th Streets and 7th and 8th Avenues. The land was purchased by a white couple, John and Elizabeth Whitehead, in 1824. It was soon subdivided into smaller plots. Columbia University's Seneca Village Project has identified Seneca Village as the first significant community of African American property owners in Manhattan. On Sept. 27,1825, Andrew Williams, a young African American, purchased three lots from the Whiteheads for $125. The same day, trustees of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church purchased six lots near 86th Street. Those trustees included Epiphany Davis, an African American store clerk, who purchased twelve lots for $578. These transactions provided the nucleus for Seneca Village. There were three churches, a school and several cemeteries. The land ""was occupied by various groups, including the African American and Irish residents of Seneca Village, as well as scattered small German farmers and Irish households,"" Elizabeth Blackmar, a Columbia University historian, told PolitiFact. By 1855, the community had grown to 264 residents, as German and Irish immigrants integrated into the village, according to the New York Times. Map of Seneca Village circa1857 By the 1840s, lower Manhattan, the original core of the city, had become unsanitary and overcrowded. Affluent and civic-minded New Yorkers grew concerned that commerce and industry were sullying the island. According to the New-York Historical Society, some leading residents resented an influx of poor immigrants and considered how to create new neighborhoods for wealthier New Yorkers. Between 1849 and 1853, New Yorkers debated how a ""grand"" park might be constructed to stretch from midtown to northern Manhattan could be created. ""In the summer of 1853, the city government authorized taking the land between 59th and 106th Streets, between Fifth and Eighth Avenues, to lay grounds for a public park. The city claimed the right of ‘eminent domain,’ which permits the state to take private land for public use, with compensation afforded to the land owners,"" wrote the New-York Historical Society. Seneca Village was directly in the path of the planned park. ""All residents were forced to vacate beginning in 1856,"" the historical society wrote, ""Approximately 1,600 people, spread over 7,500 lots of land, were directly affected by this decision. Nearly 300 of them lived in Seneca Village."" The New-York Historical Society has noted that to ease evictions, popular newspapers and magazines at the time portrayed the site of the future park as a ""wasteland"" occupied by ""squatters,"" ""shanties,"" ""bloodsuckers"" and ""insects."" But many of the residents fought to keep their land and requested higher compensation. Ultimately, Seneca Village residents were given final notice to leave in the summer of 1856. Residents were compensated for their land, but many didn’t want to leave or said their land was undervalued in the process, according to a history from the Central Park Conservancy. ""That's how Central Park was made, with most newspapers cheering the removal of ‘the insects,’"" wrote the New York Times. Some Seneca Village residents moved to different parts of the city, to Long Island, or out of New York state. Williams’ family ultimately settled in California. ""By 1857, a substantial community with deep spiritual and familial ties— some that went back more than thirty years—had vanished without leaving much evidence of its past,"" the New-York Historical Society wrote. The TikTok video said, ""Central Park actually used to be a town called Seneca Village"" founded by African Americans in 1825. Many of the earliest residents of Seneca Village were African Americans, and they were evicted through eminent domain before the park was built. The brief history on the TikTok does leave out some of the details, including that Irish and German immigrants were also residents of Seneca Village and that Seneca Village only accounted for a fraction of what became Central Park.

248,"[Claim]:""At the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books (don't) tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year.""[Evidences]:Confederate-themed posts are cropping up on social media in the wake of the Unite the Right march in Charlottesville, Va. The march was sparked by efforts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and included some marchers carrying Confederate symbols. One viral post sent to us by a reader said, ""At the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books doesn’t tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year.""The post is signed, ""Proud Southern Deplorable - Southern Rebel"" and goes on to say, ""If you're sick of the race baiting, please LIKE and SHARE."" When we took a closer look, we found that the percentage of slaveholding families was dramatically higher than what the meme said, and that the number of slaves owned by blacks was presented in a misleading way. The primary source of data about slaves and slaveholding in 1860 is that year’s census. Census data from 1860 isn’t perfect, said University of North Carolina historian Joseph T. Glatthaar, author of Soldiering in the Army of Northern Virginia: A Statistical Portrait of the Troops Who Served under Robert E. Lee. But it remains ""the best evidence we have."" In the big picture, the 1860 Census counted a total of 31,443,321 people, of which 3,953,760 were slaves. So slaves accounted for 12.6 percent of the national population. However, to address the assertion in the post requires more detailed data. Many states had outlawed slavery by 1860, so the national population figure dilutes the measurement by including many Americans whose states did not allow them to own slaves. The national population figure also includes slaves and children, and it doesn’t account either for family groupings or how many slaves a given family owned. So experts say that a more accurate measure of slaveholding in 1860 America would focus on states that allowed slavery, and would zero in on family or household units, as a way of limiting the statistical noise caused by counting slaves and children. ""The number that really matters is how many American households in the South had slaves,"" said Adam Goodheart, a Washington Collegehistorian and author of 1861: The Civil War Awakening. Using Census data to research his book, Glatthaar calculated that 4.9 percent of people in the slaveholding states owned slaves, that 19.9 percent of family units in those states owned slaves, and that 24.9 percent of households owned slaves. (Households are a broader category than families.) Each of these figures is significantly higher than the 1.4 percent cited in the social media post. State-by-state figures show some variation. In Mississippi, 49 percent of families owned slaves, and in South Carolina, 46 percent did. In border states, the percentage was lower -- 3 percent in Delaware and 12 percent in Maryland. The median for slaveholding states was about 27 percent. Using the same data, it's possible to calculate the statistic of dubious value cited in the viral image -- the percentage of all American families that owned slaves. The answer: 7.4 percent, which about five times greater than what the meme says. It's also possible that the Census data is misleadingly low, Goodheart said. ""Many non-slaveholding whites in the South rented slaves from wealthier slaveholders,"" he said. ""So it was very common for a white Southerner to be a 'slave master' but not technically a 'slave owner."" We were unable to find hard data to debunk -- or support -- this figure. The most solid data we found was published in an article in the Root by Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard University historian. Gates cited research by Carter G. Woodson, an African-American historian who died in 1950. He found that in 1830, a total of ""3,776 free Negroes owned 12,907 slaves."" With three more decades of population growth, it’s plausible that the number of black-owned slaves could have grown to 20,000 by 1860, historians told us. ""I'd imagine that the (20,000 figure) quoted in the meme is probably not that far off from being true,"" said Junius Rodriguez, a Eureka College historian and author of Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia. But the 20,000 number is not necessarily as eye-popping as the meme makes it out to be. For starters, even if the number is accurate, it would still account for just a tiny percentage of all slaves held in the United States in 1860 -- specifically, one half of 1 percent. That runs contrary to the post’s framing. ""That’s a very small number compared to Latin American or Caribbean societies,"" said Stephanie McCurry, a Columbia University historian and author of Confederate Reckoning: Power and Politics in the Civil War South. In addition, the figure is almost certainly inflated by a legal quirk in most antebellum southern states. It includes ""many ‘owned’ family members whom they had purchased to become free,"" said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian and the author of such books as The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery. ""You could not free a slave in most southern states without sending them out of the state."" Gates, writing in the Root, noted that the late historian Thomas J. Pressly used Woodson's statistics for 1830 to determine that about 42 percent of these black slaveholders owned just one slave. To Gates, this suggests that many -- though hardly all -- black ""slaveholders"" legally needed to ""own"" a family member such as a wife or child. As Woodson wrote in his 1924 book Free Negro Owners of Slaves in the United States in 1830, ""In many instances the husband purchased the wife or vice versa. … Slaves of Negroes were in some cases the children of a free father who had purchased his wife. If he did not thereafter emancipate the mother, as so many such husbands failed to do, his own children were born his slaves and were thus reported to the numerators."" In other cases, Woodson wrote, ""Benevolent Negroes often purchased slaves to make their lot easier by granting them their freedom for a nominal sum, or by permitting them to work it out on liberal terms."" The viral post said that ""at the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books doesn’t tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year."" In reality, far more than 1.4 percent of families in slaveholding states -- the most reasonable way to measure it -- owned slaves. The number was between 20 and 25 percent, and in some states, the rate was twice as high. As for black-owned slaves, they certainly existed, but they represented a tiny fraction of all slaves in the United States, and many were likely ""owned"" by their spouses or parents due to the prevailing laws in many slaveholding states. We rate the statement False.",False,True
